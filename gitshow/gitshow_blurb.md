This is a call for sound artists, digital musicians and composers to participate in a distributed, open-source electronic music composition and instrument design experiment under development and direction by Michael Palumbo and Dr. Doug Van Nort of the Distributed Performance and Sensorial Immersion (Dispersion) Lab. This research-creation project will comprise brief phases of programming and/or hacking of software-based digital musical instruments, composing etudes, and group improvisations, held weekly from mid-November to mid-December 2018, culminating in at least one public performance at a local music venue in December or January. 

The project will begin with each participant creating and uploading drafts of an initial software instrument and musical score to their own git repository (a public, open-access and distributed digital archive). Each upload will also contain notes about the state of their project (i.e. whats working or not working, sentiments, questions etc.) At the end of every week,  , each Git repository will be reassigned to a different participant, granting new authorship over the continued development of another’s instrument, score, and recordings. No limitations will be imposed on the extent to which an artist-designer can modify another’s source code or scores; rather artists will simply be asked to: [1] listen to recordings; [2] record their own performance of the previous composer's score; and [3] redesign and contribute their own version of the score, instrument, and recordings before the end of that cycle. 

The weekly improvisation sessions, held in the Dispersion Lab, will help participants ensure that each instrument is in a ready state prior to being sent to a another artist-designer , but also serve as an opportunity to experiment with how to stage the culminating public performance. The sessions will be 1-2 hours in length, and scheduling and durations will be agreed upon in advance and will start and end on time. 

Scores can be any digital format (text-based, graphic, notated, voiced instructions, etc.)

Here is perhaps the most fun part!: for the public performance, participants will not know until the moment they go on stage which instrument they will be assigned to perform. 
 Requirements:
- A laptop, audio interface, and Max/MSP (free trial versions last 30 days). 
- Must possess a working knowledge of Max/MSP. 
- Some familiarity with a command line interface and git is also required, although with enough interest a short, focused workshop could be provided to introduce you to these two systems. 
- A github.com account will be required (sign up is free). 
- Must be willing to share all of your work (including rough drafts) as open-source and open-access. 
- A sense of adventure and desire to explore experimental sound-based perofrmance and instrument design!
