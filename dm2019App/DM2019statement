Dear memebers of the York Faculty of Graduate Studies selection committee,

This letter is in support of my application to the PhD Program in Digital Media for the fall of 2019. I am an artist and academic, currently working on my PhD in Theatre and Performance Studies at York, and [how to word this?] I am seeking to transfer over to the department of Digital Media.
