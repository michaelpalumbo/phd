I’ve long been unsure how to define this: is experiencing how a work is organized along file directories, across applications, across documents, etc, an ontological perspective? (computer/info science); or as a semantic network?

This bears further discussion as a potentially interesting point

Reflecting on whether you are truly concerned with ontological or epistomelogical questions is a wonderful point of departure for this kind of work. An in-field reference worth checking is Cariani's article from Computers and Creativity.
Thanks for this reference. I’ve only done a quick read of it, but I can also see how the sections on ‘observing systems’ from this article may be useful for also thinking around the degree to which the computational system that manages the phases (and potentially interacts with performers during a show) has agency.
