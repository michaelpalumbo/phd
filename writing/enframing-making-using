On the red highlighted section: that Brown article is compelling. Interesting that he offers a counter to Latour’s ** assertion “…that his view of technologies is ontologically oppositional to Martin Heidegger’s… [that] Heidegger (1977) suggests that the ontological status of technologies is grounded in the way they reflect aspects of their makers and users, as what he termed their capacity for ‘revealing’ and ‘enframing’**. These aspects of reflected and imbued intent are significant in ascribing agency to computer music technologies.” (Brown 180) 


Yes! And how does/n't the stretching of autonomy and causality in contemporary interactive systems shift this stance?! Before even mentioning distributed authorship... (Doug 29/08/2018)
