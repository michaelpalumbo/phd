I want to write a license for this repository. I’ve never done it before, but I think it’d be a good practice to establish for myself, and it could be a good way to experiment with licenses in view of the case of the lab’s own repo(s). Just because we have the codebase in a private repository, does not mean it isn’t being shared (most of us have clones of dispersion-lab on our own machines), so this alone makes sense to have one.

Great! I’m really pleased to see this, as I’ve wondered about prospects of publishing open access whilst still submitting to historically closed-access periodicals/conferences. 
I believe there is literature more germane to open access software, no? The above seems to focus on publication of written texts.

Issues around consent: Michael is gaining from this piece. If you change the rules of the piece during the run, you would have to get a new consent from everybody. It might be for people, they might say as a composer they might be more comfortable with it as an experiment, but not as an artistic piece. (dialog with Jacky Sawatzky 30/9/2018)

On ethics: privacy of the data. What responsibility do you have to protect people’s privacy? Can you do a psych experiment in the public?

Me: if your data and the attribution of who did/said what is out in the open, then this might fail ethics. But if people’s contributions are not attributed publicly, then I only stand to gain.

If data is made public, you can’t control how it is interpreted/used by others. (dialog with Jacky Sawatzky 30/9/2018)
