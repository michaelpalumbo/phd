            <Text>“Do not be negligent and careless just because the materials seem plain, and hesitate to work more diligently with materials of superior quality. Your attitude towards things should not be contingent upon their quality. A person who is influenced by the quality of a thing, or who changes his speech or manner according to the appearance or position of the people he meets, is not a man working in the Way.” (Dogen 7)
- I go two ways on this one. On the one hand, I try to be open as a listener to all sounds, to accept all sounds and try to react to them with equal consideration and seriousness. Yet I also have training as a composer, and in this training I have cultivated a certain perspective and expectations for sonic qualities, and I do not know if I should busy myself with those sounds which do not attract my attention. </Text>

            <Text>	“I also like to encourage people without musical training to engage in improvisation to experience making their own music.”( Oliveros - deep listening - xvi)

“I composed Sonic Meditations — a body of work that could be done by persons without musical training. Sonic Mediatations are based on patterns of attention. In other words these pieces are ways of listening and responding. Sonic Meditations is the basis of Deep Listening. I noticed that many musicians were not listening to what they were performing! … There was disconnection from the environment that included the audience as the music was played. Observing these phenomena prompted me to investigate human attention processes and strategies.” (xvii)


“My performances as an improvising composer are especially informed by my Deep Listening practice. I do practice what I preach. When I arrive on stage, I am listening and expanding to the whole of the space/time continuum of perceptible sound. I have no preconceived ideas. What I perceive as the continuum of sound and energy takes my attention and informs what I play. What I play is recognized consciously by me slightly (milliseconds) after I have played any sound. This altered state of consciousness in performance is exhilarating and inspiring. The music comes through as if I have nothing to do with it but allow it to emerge through y instrument and voice. It is even more exciting to practice, whether Iam performing or just living out my daily life.” (xix)

The ‘deep’ in Deep Listening is suggestive of something that “…surpasses one’s present understanding or has too many unknown parts to grasp easily. A ‘deep one’ defies stereotypical knowing and may take either a long time, or never to understand or get to know.” (xix) 

“Deep coupled with Listening or Deep Listening for me is learning to expand the perception of sounds to include the whole space/time continuum of sound — encountering the vastness and complexities as much as possible. Simultaneously one ought to be able to target a sound or sequence of sounds as a focus within the space/time continuum and to perceive the detail or trajectory of the sound or sequence of sounds. Such focus should always return to, or be within the whole of the space/time continuum (context). Such expansion means that one is connected to the whole of the environment and beyond” (xix)

“…when practicing the Way, from the very beginning, listen to the teacher and conduct your self in accordance with his teaching. You should remember and know thoroughly that dharma turns the Self [all phenomena influence us] and that the self turns dharma [ we influence all dharma or phenomena]. When we influence dharma, dharma is weak and we are strong. When dharma influences us, dharma is strong and we are weak. Both of these principles have always been a part of the Teachings of the buddhadarma.” (Yojinshu in Dogen 101)

            <Title>Wittgenstein_ Philosophical Investigations</Title>
            <Text>excerpts from PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS
94. 'A proposition is a queer thing!' Here we have in germ the subliming of our whole account of logic. The tendency to assume a pure intermediary between the propositional signs and the facts. Or even to try to purify, to sublime, the signs themselves. -- For our forms of expression prevent us in all sorts of ways from seeing that nothing out of the ordinary is involved, by sending us in pursuit of chimeras.
95. "Thought must be something unique." When we say, and mean, that such-and-such is the case, we -- and our meaning -- do not stop anywhere short of the fact; but we mean: this -- is -- so. But this paradox (which has the form of a truism) can also be expressed in this way: Thought can be of what is not the case.
96. Other illusions come from various quarters to attach themselves to the special one spoken of here. Thought, language, now appear to us as the unique correlate, picture, of the world. These concepts: proposition, language, thought, world, stand in line one behind the other, each equivalent to each. (But what are these words to be used for now? The language-game in which they are to be applied is missing.)
97. Thought is surrounded by a halo. -- Its essence, logic, presents an order, in fact the a priori order of the world: that is, the order of possibilities, which must be common to both world and thought. But this order, it seems, must be utterly simple. It is prior to all experience, must run through all experience; no empirical cloudiness or uncertainty can be allowed to affect it. -- It must rather be of the purest crystal. But this crystal does not appear as an abstraction; but as something concrete, indeed, as the most concrete -- as it were the hardest thing there is (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus No. 5.5563).
We are under the illusion that what is peculiar, profound, essential, in our investigation, resides in its trying to grasp the incomparable essence of language. That is, the order existing between
the concepts of proposition, word, proof, truth, experience, and so on. This order is a super -- order between -- so to speak -- super -- concepts. Whereas, of course, if the words "language", "experience", "world", have a use, it must be as humble a one as that of the words "table", "lamp", "door".
98. On the one hand it is clear that ever sentence in our language is in order as it is. That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our ordinary vague sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language awaited construction by us. -- On the other hand it seems clear that where there is sense there must be perfect order. So there must be perfect order even in the vaguest sentence.
99. The sense of a sentence -- one would like to say -- may, of course, leave this or that open, but the sentence must nevertheless have a definite sense. An indefinite sense -- that would really not be a sense at all. -- This is like: An indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all. Here one thinks perhaps: if I say "I have locked the man up fast in the room -- there is only one door left open" -- then I simply haven't locked him in at all; his being locked in is a sham. One would be inclined to say here: "You haven't done anything at all". An enclosure with a hole in it is as good as none. -- But is that true?
100. "But still, it isn't a game, if there is some vagueness in the rules." -- But does this prevent its being a game? -- "Perhaps you'll call it a game, but at any rate it certainly isn't a perfect game." This means it has impurities, and what I am interested in at present is the pure article. - - But I want to say: we misunderstand the role of the ideal in our language. That is to say: we too should call it a game, only we are dazzled by the ideal and therefore fail to see clearly the actual use of the word game.
101. We want to say that there can't be any vagueness in logic. The idea now absorbs us, that the ideal 'must' be found in reality. Mean while we do not as yet see how it occurs there, nor do we understand the nature of this "must". We think it must be in reality: for we think we already see it there.
102. The strict and clear rules of the logical structure of propositions appear to us as something in the background -- hidden in the medium of the understanding. I already see them (even though through a medium): for I understand the propositional sign, I use it to say something.
103. The ideal, as we think of it, is unshakable. You can never get outside it; you must always turn back. There is no outside; outside you cannot breathe. -- Where does this idea come from? It is like a pair of glasses on our nose through which we see whatever we look at. It never occurs to us to take them off.
106. Here it is difficult as it were to keep our heads up, -- to see that we must stick to the subjects of our everyday thinking, and not go astray and imagine that we have to describe extreme subtleties, which in turn we are after all quite unable to describe with the means at our disposal. We feel as if we had to repair a torn spider's web with our fingers.
107. The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a result of investigation: it was a requirement.) The conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty. -- We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need friction. Back to the rough ground!
108. We see that what we call "sentence" and "language" has not the formal unity that I imagined, but is the family of structures more or less related to one another. -- But what becomes of logic now? Its rigor seems to be giving way here. -- But in that case doesn't logic altogether disappear? -- For how can it lose its rigor? Of course not by our bargaining any of its rigor out of it. -- The preconceired idea of crystalline purity can only be removed by turning our whole examination around. (One might say: the axis of reference of our examination must be rotated, but about the fixed point of our real need.)
The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences and words in exactly the sense in which we speak of them in ordinary life when we say e.g. "Here is a Chinese sentence", or "No, that only looks like writing; it is actually just an ornament" and so on.
We are talking about the spatial and temporal phenomenon of language, not about some non -- spatial, non -- temporal phantasm. [Note in margin: Only it is possible to be interested in a phenomenon in a variety of ways]. But we talk about it as we do about the pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties.
The question "What is a word really?" is analogous to "What is a piece in chess?"
109. It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. It was not of any possible interest to us to find out empirically that, contrary to our preconceived ideas, it is possible to think such-and-such -- whatever that may mean. (The conception of thought as a gaseous medium.) And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place. And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems, they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.
110. Language (or thought?) is something unique" -- this proves to be a superstition (not a mistake!), itself produced by grammatical illusions.
And now the impressiveness retreats to these illusions, to the problems.
111. The problems arising through a misinterpretation of our forms of language have the character of depth. They are deep disquietudes; their roots are as deep in us as the forms of our language and their significance is as great as the importance of our language. Let us ask ourselves: why do we feel a grammatical joke to be deep? (And that is what the depth of philosophy is.)
112. A simile that has been absorbed into the forms of our language produces a false appearance, and this disquiets us. "But this isn't how it is!" -- we say. "Yet this is how it has to be!"
113. "But this is how it is --" I say to myself over and over again. I feel as though, if only I could fix my gaze absolutely sharply on this fact, get it in focus, I must grasp the essence of the matter.
114. (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 4.5): "The general form of propositions is: This is how things are." That is the kind of proposition that one repeats to oneself countless times. One thinks that one is tracing the outline of the thing's nature over and over again, and one is merely tracing round the frame through which we look at it.
115. A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and
language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.
116. When philosophers use a word -- "knowledge", "being", "object", "I", "proposition", "name" -- and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: is the word ever actually used in this way in the language which is its original home? --
What we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.
117. You say to me: "You understand this expression, don't you? Well then -- I am using it in the sense you are familiar with." -- As if the sense were an atmosphere accompanying the word, which it carried with it into every kind of application.
If, for example, someone says that the sentence "This is here" (saying which he points to an object in front of him) makes sense to him then he should ask himself in what special circumstances this sentence is actually used. There it does make sense.
118. Where does our investigation get its importance from, since it seems only to destroy everything interesting, that is, all that is great and important? (As it were all the buildings, leaving behind only bits of stone and rubble.) What we are destroying is nothing but houses of cards and we are clearing up the ground of language on which they stand.
119. The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head up against the limits of language. These bumps make us see the value of the discovery.
120. When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I must speak the language of every day. Is this language somehow too coarse and material for what we want to say? Then how is another one to be constructed? -- And how strange that we should be able to do anything at all with the one we travel
In giving explanations I already have to use language full -- blown (not some sort of preparatory, provisional one); this by itself shows that I can adduce only exterior facts about language.
Yes, but then how can these explanations satisfy us? -- Well, your very questions were framed in this language; they had to be expressed in this language, if there was anything to ask!
And your scruples are misunderstandings.
Your questions refer to words; so I have to talk about words.
You say: the point isn't the word, but its meaning, and you think of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though also different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The money, and the cow that you can buy with it. (But contrast: money, and its use.)
121. One might think: if philosophy speaks of the use of the word "philosophy" there must be a second -- order philosophy. But it is not so: it is, rather, like the case of orthography, which deals with the word "orthography" among others without then being second -- order.
122. A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not command a clear view of the use of our words. -- Our grammar is lacking in just this sort of perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding which consists in 'seeing connections'. Hence the importance of finding and inventing intermediate cases.
The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental significance for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we look at things. (Is this a 'Weltanschauung'?)
123. A philosophical problem has the form: "I don't know my way around."
124. Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language, it can in the end only
describe it.
For it cannot give it any foundation either.
It leaves everything as it is.
It also leaves mathematics as it is, and no mathematical discovery can advance it. A "leading problem of mathematical logic" is for us a problem of mathematics like any other.
125. It is the business of philosophy, not to resolve a contradiction by means of a mathematical or logico -- mathematical discovery, but to make it possible for us to get a clear view of the state of mathematics that troubles us: the state of affairs before the contradiction is resolved. (And this does not mean that one is sidestepping a difficulty.)
The fundamental fact here is that we lay down rules, a technique, for a game, and that then when we follow the rules, things do not turn out as we had assumed. That we are therefore as it were entangled in our own rules.
This entanglement in our rules is what we want to understand (i.e. get a clear view of).
It throws light on our concept of meaning something. For in those cases things turn out otherwise than we had meant, foreseen. That is just what we say when, for example, a
￼contradiction appears: "I didn't mean it like that."
The civil status of a contradiction, or its status in civil life: there is the philosophical problem.
126. Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything. -- Since everything 1les open to view there is nothing to explain. For what is hidden, for example, is of no interest to us.
One might also give the name "philosophy" to what is possible before all new discoveries and inventions.
127. The work of the philosopher consists in assembling reminders for a particular purpose.
128. If one tried to advance theses in philosophy, it would never be possible to debate them, because everyone would agree to them.
129. The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice something -- because it is always before one's eyes.) The real foundations of his inquiry do not strike a man at all. Unless that fact has at some time struck him. -- And this means: we fail to be struck by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful.
130. Our clear and simple language-games are not preparatory studies for a future regularization of language -- as it were first approximations, ignoring friction and air -- resistance. The language- games are rather set up as objects of comparison which are meant to throw light on the facts of our 1anguage by way not only of similarities, but also of dissimilarities.
131. For we can avoid ineptness or emptiness in our assertions only by presenting the model as
￼what it is, as an object of comparison -- as, so to speak, a measuring -- rod; not as a preconceived idea to which reality must correspond. (The dogmatism into which we fall so easily in doing philosophy.)
132. We want to establish an order in our knowledge of the use of language: an order with a particular end in view, one out of many possible orders; not the order. To this end we shall constantly be giving prominence to distinctions which our ordinary forms of language easily make us overlook. This may make it look as if we saw it as our task to reform language.
Such a reform for particular practical purposes, an improvement in our terminology designed to prevent misunderstandings in practice, is perfectly possible. But these are not the cases we have to do with. The confusions which occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work.
133. It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the use of our words in unheard- of ways.
For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity But this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear.
The read discovery is the one that makes me capable of stopping doing philosophy when I want to. -- The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring in question. -- Instead, we now demonstrate a method, by examples; and the series of examples can be broken off. -- Problems are solved (difficulties eliminated), not a single problem.
There is not a philosophical method, though there are indeed methods, like different therapies.
134. Let us examine the proposition: "This is how things are." -- How can I say that this is the general form of propositions? -- It is first and foremost itself a proposition, an English sentence, for it has a subject and a predicate. But how is this sentence applied -- that is, in our everyday language? For I got it from there and nowhere else.
We may say' e.g.: "He explained his position to me, said that this was how things were, and that therefore he needed an advance". So far, then, one can say that that sentence stands for any statement It is employed as a propositional schema, but on) because it has the
￼construction of an English sentence. It would be possible to say instead "such and such is the case", "this is the situation", and so on. It would also be possible here simply to use a letter, a variable, as in symbolic logic. But no one is going to call the letter "p" the general form of propositions. To repeat: "This is how things are" had that position only because it is itself what one calls an English sentence. But though it is a proposition, still it gets employed as a propositional variable. To say that this proposition agrees (or does not agree) with reality would be obvious nonsense. Thus it illustrates the fact that one feature of our concept of a proposition is, sounding like a proposition.
135. But haven't we got a concept of what a proposition is, of what we take "proposition" to mean? -- Yes; just as we also have a concept of what we mean by "game". Asked what a proposition is -- whether it is another person or ourselves that we have to answer -- we shall give examples and these will include what one may call inductively defined series of propositions. This is the kind of way in which we have such a concept as proposition'. (Compare the concept of a proposition with the concept of number.)
136. At bottom, giving "This is how things are" as the general form of propositions is the same as giving the definition: a proposition is whatever can be true or false. For instead of "This is how things are" I could have said "This is true". (Or again "This is false".) But we have
'p' is true = p
'p' is false = not-p.
And to say that a proposition is whatever can be true or false amounts to saying: we call something a proposition when in our language we apply the calculus of truth functions to it.
Now it looks as if the definition -- a proposition is whatever can be true or false -- determined what a proposition was, by saying: what fits the concept 'true', or what the concept 'true' fits, is a proposition. So it is as if we had a concept of true and false, which we could use to determine what is and what is not a proposition. What engages with the concept of truth (as with a cogwheel) is a proposition.
But this is a bad picture. It is as if one were to say "The king in chess is the piece that one can check." But this can mean no more than that in our game of chess we only check the king. Just as the proposition that only a proposition can be true or false can say no more than that we only predicate "true" and "false" of what we call a proposition. And what a proposition is is in
one sense determined by the rules of sentence formation (in English for example), and in another sense by the use of the sign in the language-game. And the use of the words "true" and "false" may be among the constituent parts of this v game; and if so it belongs to our concept 'Proposition' but does not AS we might also say, check belongs to our concept of the king in chess (as so to speak a constituent part of it). To say that check did not it our concept of the pawns, would mean that a game in which pawns were checked, in which, say, the players who lost their pawns lost, would be uninteresting or stupid or too complicated or something of the kind.
137. What about learning to determine the subject of a sentence by means of the question "Who or what ....?" -- Here, surely, there is such a thing as the subject's 'fitting' this question; for otherwise how should we find out what the subject was by means of the question? We find it out much as we find out which letter of the alphabet comes after 'K' by saying the alphabet up to 'K' to ourselves. Now in what sense does 'L' fit on to this series of letters? -- In that sense "true" and "false" could be said to fit propositions; and a child might be taught to distinguish between propositions and other expressions by being told "Ask yourself if you can say 'is true' after it. If these words fit it's a proposition." (And in the same way one might have said: Ask yourself if you can put the words "This is how things are:" in front of it.)
138. But can't the meaning of a word that I understand fit the sense of a sentence that I understand? Or the meaning of one word fit the meaning of another? Of course, if the meaning is the use we make of the word, it makes no sense to speak of such 'fitting'. But we understand the meaning of a word when we hear or say it; we grasp it in a flash, and what we grasp in this way is surely something different from the use which is extended in time!
.. .
239. How is he to know what color he is to pick out when he hears "red"? -- Quite simple: he is to take the color whose image occurs to him when he hears the word. -- But how is he to know which color it is 'whose image occurs to him'? Is a further criterion needed for that? (There is indeed such a procedure as choosing the color which occurs to one when one hears the word "....")
"'Red' means the color that occurs to me when I hear the word 'red'" -- would be a definition. Not an explanation of what it is to use a word as a name.
￼
￼240. Disputes do not break out (among mathematicians, say) over the question whether a rule has been obeyed or not. People don't come to blows over it, for example. That is part of the framework on which the working of our language is based (for example, in giving descriptions).
241. "So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?" -- It is what human beings say that is true and false, and they agree in the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.
242. If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgments. This seems to abolish logic, but does not do so. -- It is one thing to describe methods of measurement, and another to obtain and state results of measurement. But what we call "measuring" is partly determined by a certain constancy in results of measurement.
243. A human being can encourage himself, give himself orders, obey, blame and punish himself, he can ask himself a question and answer it. We could even imagine human beings who spoke only in monologue; who accompanied their activities by talking to themselves. -- An explorer who watched them and listened to their talk might succeed in translating their language into ours. (This would enable him to predict these people's actions correctly, for he also hears them making resolutions and decisions.)
But could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or give vocal expression to his inner experiences -- his feelings, moods, and the rest -- for his private use? Well, can't we do so in our ordinary language? -- But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the language.
244. How do words refer to sensations? -- There doesn't seem to be any problem here; don't we talk about sensations every day, and give them names? But how is the connection between the name and the thing named set up? This question is the same as: how does a human being learn the meaning of the names of sensations? -- of the word "pain" for example. Here is one possibility: words are connected with the primitive, the natural, expressions of the sensation and used in their place. A child has hurt himself and he cries; and then adults talk to him and teach him exclamations and, later, sentences. They teach the child new pain -- behavior.
￼"So you are saying that the word 'pain' really means crying?" -- On the contrary: the verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe it.
245. For how can I go so far as to try to use language to get between pain and its expression?
246. In what sense are my sensations private? -- Well, only I can know whether I am really in pain; another person can only surmise it. -- In one way this is wrong, and in another nonsense. If we are using the word "to know" as it is normally used (and how else are we to use it?), then other people very often know when I am in pain. -- Yes, but all the same not with the certainty with which I know it myself! -- It can't be said of me at all (except perhaps as a joke) that I now I am in pain. What is it supposed to mean -- except perhaps that I am in pain?
Other people cannot be said to learn of my sensations only from my behavior -- for I cannot be said to learn of them. I have them.
The truth is: it makes sense to say about other people that they doubt whether I am in pain; but not to say it about myself.
247. "Only you can know if you had that intention." One might tell someone this when one was explaining the meaning of the word "intention" to him. For then it means: that is how we use it.
(And here "know', means that the expression of uncertainty is senseless.)
248. The proposition "Sensations are private" is comparable to; "One plays patience by oneself".
249. Are we perhaps over -- hasty in our assumption that the smile of an unweaned infant is not a presence? -- And on what experience is our assumption based?
(Lying is a language-game that needs to be learned like any other one.)
250. Why can't a dog simulate pain? Is he too honest? Could one teach a dog to simulate pain? Perhaps it is possible to teach him to howl on particular occasions as if he were in pain, even when he is not. But the surroundings which are necessary for this behavior to be real simulation are missing.
251. What does it mean when we say: "I can't imagine the opposite of this" or "What would it be
￼like, if it were otherwise?" -- For example, when someone has said that my images are private, or that only I myself can know whether I am feeling pain, and similar things.
Of course, here "I can't imagine the opposite" doesn't mean: my powers of imagination are unequal to the task. These words are a defense against something' whose form makes it look like an empirical proposition, but which is really a grammatical one.
But why do we say: "I can't imagine the opposite"? Why not: "I can't imagine the thing itself"?
Example: "Every rod has a length." That means something like: we call something (or this) "the length of a rod" -- but nothing "the length of a sphere." Now can I imagine 'every rod having a length'? Well, I simply imagine a rod. Only this picture, in connection with this proposition, has a quite different role from one used in connection with the proposition "This table has the same length as the one over there". For here I understand what it means to have a picture of the opposite (nor need it be a mental picture).
But the picture attaching to the grammatical proposition could only show, say, what is called "the length of a rod". And what should the opposite picture be ?
(Remark about the negation of an a priori proposition.)
252. "This body has extension." To this we might reply: "Nonsense!" -- but are inclined to reply "Of course!" Why is this?
253. "Another person can't have my pains." -- Which are my pains? What counts as a criterion of identity here? Consider what makes it possible in the case of physical objects to speak of "two exactly the same", for example, to say "This chair is not the one you saw here yesterday, but is exactly the same as it".
In so far as it makes sense to say that my pain is the same as his, it is also possible for us both to have the same pain. (And it would a]so be imaginable for two people to feel pain in the same -- not just the corresponding -- place. That might be the case with Siamese twins, for instance.)
I have seen a person in a discussion on this subject strike himself on the breast and say: "But surely another person can't have THIS pain!" -- The answer to this is that one does not define a criterion of identity by emphatic stressing of the word "this". Rather, what the emphasis does
￼is to suggest the case in which we are familiar with such a criterion of identity, but have to be reminded of it.
254. The substitution of "identical" for "the same" (for instance) is another typical expedient in philosophy. As if we were talking about shades of meaning and all that were in question were to find words to hit on the correct nuance. That is in question in philosophy only where we have to give a psychologically exact account of the temptation to use a particular kind of expression. What we 'are tempted to say' in such a case is, of course, not philosophy; but it is its raw material. Thus, for example, what a mathematician is inclined to say about the objectivity and reality of mathematical facts, is not a philosophy of mathematics, but something for philosophical treatment.
255. The philosopher treats a question; like an illness.
256. Now, what about the language which describes my inner experiences and which only I myself can understand? How do I use words to stand for my sensations? -- As we ordinarily do? Then are my words for sensations tied up with my natural expressions of sensation? In that case my language is not a 'private' one. Someone else might understand it as well as I. -- But suppose I didn't have any natural expression for the sensation, but only had the sensation? And now I simply associate names with sensations and use these names in descriptions.
257. "What would it be like if human beings showed no outward signs of pain (did not groan, grimace, etc.)? Then it would be impossible to teach a child the use of the word 'tooth -- ache'." -- Well, let's assume the child is a genius and itself invents a name for the sensation! -- But then, of course, he couldn't make himself understood when he used the word. -- So does he understand the name, without being able to explain its meaning to anyone? -- But what does it mean to say that he has 'named his pain'? -- How has he done this naming of pain?! And whatever he did, what was its purpose? -- When one says "He gave a name to his sensation" one forgets that a great deal of stage -- setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act of naming is to make sense. And when we speak of someone's having given a name to pain, what is presupposed is the existence of the grammar of the word "pain"; it shows the post where the new word is stationed.
258. Let us imagine the following case. I want to keep a diary about the recurrence of a certain sensation.
￼To this end I associate it with the sign "S" and write this sign in a calendar for every day on which I have the sensation. I will remark first of all that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated. -- But still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition. -- How? Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write the sign down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the sensation -- and so, as it were, point to it inwardly. -- But what is this ceremony for? for that is all it seems to be! A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign. -- Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connection between the sign and the sensation. -- But "I impress it on myself" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connection right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness. One would like to say: whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'.
259. Are the rules of the private language impressions of rules? -- The balance on which impressions are weighed is not the impression of a balance.
260. "Well, I believe that this is the sensation S again." -- Perhaps you believe that you believe it!
Then did the man who made the entry in the calendar make a note of nothing whatever? -- Don't consider it a matter of course that a person is making a note of something when he makes a mark -- say in a calendar. For a note has a function, and this "S" so far has none.
(One can talk to oneself. -- If a person speaks when no one else is present, does that mean he is speaking to himself?)
261. What reason have we for calling "S" the sign for a sensation? For "sensation" is a word of our common language. not of one intelligible to me alone. So the use of this word stands in need of a justification which everybody understands. -- And it would not help either to say that it need not be a sensation; that when he writes "S", he has something -- and that is all that can be said. "Has" and "something" also belong to our common language. -- So in the end when one is doing philosophy one gets to the point where one would like just to emit an inarticulate sound. -- But such a sound is an expression only as it occurs in a particular language-game, which should now be described.
262. It might be said: if you have given yourself a private definition of a word, then you must inwardly undertake to use the word in such-and-such a way. And how do you undertake that? Is
￼it to be assumed that you invent the technique of using the word; or that you found it ready -- made?
263. "But I can (inwardly) undertake to call THIS 'pain' in the future." -- "But is it certain that you have undertaken it? Are you sure that it was enough for this purpose to concentrate your attention on your feeling?" -- A queer question. --
264. "Once you know what the word stands for, you understand it, you know its whole use."
265. Let us imagine a table (something like a dictionary) that exists only in our imagination. A dictionary can be used to justify the translation of a word X by a word Y. But are we also to call it a justification if such a table is to be looked up only in the imagination? -- "Well, yes; then it is a subjective justification." -- But justification consists in appealing to something independent. -- "But surely I can appeal from one memory to another. For example, I don't know if I nave remembered the time of departure of a train right and to check it I call to mind how a page of the time -- table looked. Isn't it the same here?" -- No; for this process has got to produce a memory which is actually correct. If the mental image of the time -- table could not itself be tested for correctness, how could it confirm the correctness of the first memory? (As if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true.)
Looking up a table in the imagination is no more looking up a table than the image of the result of an imagined experiment is the result of an experiment.
266. I can look at the clock to see what time it is: but I can also look at the dial of a clock in order to "Mess what time it is; or for the same purpose move the hand of a clock till its position strikes me as right. So the look of a clock may serve to determine the time in more than one way. "Looking at the clock in imagination.)
267. Suppose I wanted to justify the choice of dimensions for a bridge which I imagine to be building, by making loading tests on the material of the bridge in my imagination. This would, of course, be to imagine what is called justifying the choice of dimensions for a bridge. But should we also call it justifying an imagined choice of dimensions?
268. Why can't my right hand give my left hand money? -- My right hand can put it into my left
￼hand. My right hand can write a deed of gift and my left hand a receipt. -- But the further practical consequences would not be those of a gift. When the left hand has taken the money from the right, etc., we shall ask: "Well, and what of it?" And the same could be asked if a person had given himself a private definition of a word; I mean, if he has said the word to himself and at the same time has directed his attention to a sensation.
269. Let us remember that there are certain criteria in a man's behavior for the fact that he does not understand a word: that it means nothing to him, that he can do nothing with it. And criteria for his 'thinking he understands', attaching some meaning to the word, but not the right one. And, lastly, criteria for his understanding the word right. In the second case one might speak of a subjective understanding. And sounds which no one else understands but which I 'appear to understand' might be called a "private language".
270. Let us now imagine a use for the entry of the sign "S" in my diary. I discover that whenever I have a particular sensation a manometer shows that my blood -- pressure rises. So I shall be able to say that my blood -- pressure is rising without using any apparatus. This is a useful result. And now it seems quite indifferent whether I have recognized the sensation right or not. Let us suppose I regularly identify it wrong, it does not matter in the least. And that alone shows he turned a knob which looked as if it could be used to turn on some part of the machine; but it was a mere ornament, not connected with the mechanism at all.)
And what is our reason for calling "S" the name of a sensation here? Perhaps the kind of way this sign is employed in this language-game. -- And why a "particular sensation," that is, the same one every time? Well, aren't we supposing that we write "S" every time?
271. "Imagine a person whose memory could not retain what the word 'pain' meant -- so that he constantly called different things by that name -- but nevertheless used the word in a way fitting in with the usual symptoms and presuppositions of pain" -- in short he uses it as we all do. Here I should like to say: a wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of the mechanism.
272. The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people also have this or something else. The assumption would thus be possible -- though unverifiable -- that one section of mankind had one sensation of red and another section another.
￼273. What am I to say about the word "red"? -- that it means something 'confronting us all' and that everyone should really have another word, besides this one, to mean his own sensation of red? Or is it like this: the word "red" means something known to everyone; and in addition, for each person, it means something known only to him? (Or perhaps rather: it refers to something known only to him.)
274. Of course, saying that the word "red" "refers to" instead of "means" something private does not help us in the least to grasp its function; but it is the more psychologically apt expression for a particular experience in doing philosophy. It is as if when I uttered the word I cast a sidelong glance at the private sensation, as it were in order to say to myself: I know all right what I mean by it.
275. Look at the blue of the sky and say to yourself "How blue the sky is!" -- When you do it spontaneously -- without philosophical intentions -- the idea never crosses your mind that this impression of color belongs only to you. And you have no hesitation in exclaiming that to someone else. And if you point at anything as you say the words you point at the sky. I am saying: you have not the feeling of pointing -- into -- yourself which often accompanies 'naming the sensation' when one is thinking about 'private language'. Nor do you think that really you ought not to point to the color with your hand, but with your attention. (Consider what it means "to point to something with the attention".)
276. But don't we at least mean something: quite definite when we look at a color and name our color -- impression? It is as if we detached the color -- impression from the object, like a membrane. (This ought to arouse our suspicions.)
277. But how is even possible for us to be tempted to think that we use a word to mean at one time the color known to everyone -- and at another the 'visual impression' which I am getting now? How can there be so much as a temptation here? I don't turn the same kind of attention on the color in the two cases. When I mean the color impression that (as I should like to say) belongs to me alone I immerse myself in the color -- rather like when I 'cannot get my fill of a color'. Hence it is easier to produce this experience when one is looking at a bright color, or at an impressive color -- scheme.
278. "I know how the color green looks to me" -- surely that makes sense! -- Certainly: what use of the proposition are you thinking of?
￼279. Imagine someone saying: "But I know how tall I am!" and laying his hand on top of his head to prove it.
280. Someone paints a picture in order to show how he imagines a theater scene. And now I say: "This picture has a double function: it informs others, as pictures or words inform but for the one who gives the information it is a representation (or piece of information?) of another kind: for him it is the picture of his image, as it can't be for anyone else. To him his private impression of the picture means what he has imagined, in a sense in which the picture cannot mean this to others." -- And what right have I to speak in this second case of a representation or piece of information -- if these words were rightly used in the first case?
281. "But doesn't what you say come to this: that there is no pain, for example, without pain -- behavior?" -- It comes to this: only of a living human being and what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say it has sensations; it sees: is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious.
282. "But in a fairy tale the pot too can see and hear!" (Certainly; but it can also talk.)
"But the fairy tale only invents what is not the case: it does not talk nonsense." -- It is not as simple as that. Is it false or nonsensical to say that a pot talks? Have we a clear picture of the circumstances in which we should say of a pot that it talked? (Even a nonsense -- poem is not nonsense in the same way as the babbling of a child.)
We do indeed say of an inanimate thing that it is in pain: when playing with dolls for example. But this use of the concept of pain is a secondary one. Imagine a case in which people ascribed pain only to inanimate things; pitied only dolls I (When children play at trains their game is connected with their knowledge of trains. ]t would nevertheless be possible for the children of a tribe unacquainted with trains to learn this game from others, and to play it without knowing that it was copied from anything. One might say that the game did not make the same sense to them as to us.)
283. What gives us so much as the idea that living beings, things, can feel?
Is it that my education has led me to it by drawing my attention to feeling in myself, and now I transfer the idea to objects outside myself? That I recognize that there is something there (in
￼me) which I can call "pain" without getting into conflict with the way other people use this word? -- I do not transfer my idea to stones, plants, etc.
Couldn't I imagine having frightful pains and turning to stone while they lasted? Well, how do I know, if I shut my eyes, whether I have not turned into a stone? And if that has happened, in what sense will the stone have the pains? In what sense will they be ascribable to the stone? And why need the pain have a bearer at all here?!
And can one say of the stone that it has a soul and that is what has the pain? What has a soul, or pain, to do with a stone?
Only of what behaves like a human being can one say that it has pains.
For one has to say it of a body, or, if you like of a soul which some body had. And how can a body have a soul?
284. Look at a stone and imagine it having sensations. -- One says to oneself: How could one so much as get the idea of ascribing a sensation to a thing? One might as well ascribe it to a number! -- And now look at a wriggling fly and at once these difficulties vanish and pain seems able to get a foothold here, where before everything was, so to speak, too smooth for it.
And so, too, a corpse seems to us quite inaccessible to pain. -- Our attitude to what is alive and to what is dead, is not the same. All our reactions are different. -- If anyone says: "That cannot simply come from the fact that a living thing moves about in such-and-such a way and a dead one not", then I want to intimate to him that this is a case of the transition 'from quantity to quality'.
285. Think of the recognition of farial expressions. Or of the description of facial expressions -- which does not consist in giving the measurements of the face! Think, too, how one can imitate a man's face without seeing one's own in a mirror.
286. But isn't it absurd to say of a body that it has pain? And why does one feel an absurdity in that? In what sense is it true that my hand does not feel pain, but I in my hand?
What sort of issue is: Is it the body that feels pain? -- How is it to be decided? What makes it plausible to say that it is not the body? --
Well, something like this: if someone has a pain in his hand, then the hand does not say so (unless it writes it) and one does not comfort the hand, but the sufferer: one looks into his face.
287. How am I filled with pity for this man? How does it come out what the object of my pity is? (Pity, one may say, is a form of conviction that someone else is in pain.)
288. I turn to stone and my pain goes on. -- Suppose I were m error and it was no longer pain? -- But I can't be in error here; it means nothing to doubt whether I am in pain! -- That means: f anyone said "I do not know if what I have is a pain or something else", we should think something like, he does not know what the English word "pain" means: and we should explain it to him. -- How? Perhaps by means of gestures, or by pricking him with a pin and saying: "See, that's what pain is!" This explanation, like any other, he might understand right, wrong, or not at all. And he will show which he does by his use of the word, in this as in other cases.
If he now said, for example: "Oh, I know what 'pain' means; what I don't know is whether this, that I have now, is pain" -- we should merely shake our heads and be forced to regard his words as a queer reaction which we have no idea what to do with. (It would be rather as if we heard someone say seriously: "I distinctly remember that sometime before I was born I believed".)
That expression of doubt has no place in the language-game; but if we cut out human behavior, which is the expression of sensation, it looks as if I might legitimately begin to doubt afresh. My temptation to say that one might take a sensation for something other than what it is arises from this: if I assume the abrogation of the normal language-game with the expression of a sensation. I need a criterion of identity for the sensation; and then the possibility of error also exists.
289. "When I say 'I am in pain' I am at any rate justified before myself." -- What does that mean? Does it mean: "If someone else could know what I am calling 'pain', he would admit that I was using the word correctly"?
To use a word without a justification does not mean to use it without right.
290. What I do is not, o course2 to identify my sensation by criteria: but to repeat an expression. But this is not the end of the language-game: it is the beginning.
￼
￼But isn't the beginning the sensation -- which I describe? -- Perhaps this word "describe" tricks us here. I say "I describe my state of mind" and "I describe my room". You need to call to mind the differences between the language-games.
291. What we call "descriptions" are instruments for particular uses. Think of a machine -- drawing, a cross -- section. an elevation with v measurements, which an engineer has before him. Thinking of a description as a word -- picture of the facts has something misleading about it: one tends to think only of such pictures as hang on our walls: which seem simply to portray how a thing looks, what it is like. (These pictures are as it were idle.)
292. Don't always think that you read off what you say from the facts; that you portray these in words according to rules. For even so you would have to apply the rule in the particular case without guidance.
293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word "pain" means -- must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?
Now someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case! Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a "beetle". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. -- Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. -- But suppose the word "beetle" had a use in these people's language? -- If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty. - - No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.
That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation' the object droops out of consideration as irrelevant.
294. If you say he sees a private picture before him, which he is describing, you have still made an assumption about what he has before him. And that means that you can describe it or do describe it more closely. If you admit that you haven't any notion what kind of thing it might be that he has before him -- then what leads you into saying, in spite of that, that he has something before him? Isn't it as if I were to say of someone: "He has something. But I don't know whether it is money, or debts, or an empty till."
￼295. "I know .... only from my own case" -- what kind of proposition is this meant to be at all? An experiential one? No. -- A grammatical one?
Suppose everyone does say about himself that he knows what pain is only from his own pain. -- Not that people really say that, or are even prepared to say it. But if everybody said it -- it might be a kind of exclamation. And even if it gives no information, still it is a picture, and why should we not want to call up such a picture? Imagine an allegorical painting take the place of those words.
When we look into ourselves as we do philosophy, we often get to see just such a picture. A full -- blown pictorial representation of our grammar. Not facts; but as it were illustrated turns of speech.
296. "Yes, but there is something there all the same accompanying my cry of pain. And it is on account of that that I utter it. And this something is what is important -- and frightful." -- Only whom are we informing of this? And on what occasion?
297. Of course, if water boils in a pot, steam comes out of the pot and also pictured steam comes out of the pictured pot. But what if one insisted on saying that there must also be something boiling in the picture of the pot?
298. The very fact that we should so much like to say: "This is the important thing" -- while we point privately to the sensation -- is enough to show how much we are inclined to say something which gives no information.
299. Being unable -- when we surrender ourselves to philosophical thought -- to help saying such- and-such; being irresistibly inclined to say it -- does not mean being forced into an assumption, or having an immediate perception or knowledge of a state of affairs.
300. It is -- we should like to say -- not merely the picture of the behavior that plays a part in the language-game with the words "he is in pain", but also the picture of the pain. Or, not merely the paradigm of the behavior, but also that of the pain. -- It is a misunderstanding to say "The picture of pain enters into the language-game with the word 'pain'." The image of pain is not a picture and this image is not replaceable in the language-game by anything that we should call
￼a picture. -- The image of pain certainly enters into the language game in a sense; only not as a picture.
301. An image is not a picture, but a picture can correspond to it.
302. If one has to imagine someone else's pain on the model of one's own, this is none too easy a thing to do: for I have to imagine pain which I do not feel on the model of the pain which I do feel. That is, what I have to do is not simply to make a transition in imagination from one place of pain to another. As, from pain in the hand to pain in the arm. For I am not to imagine that I feel pain in some region of his body. (Which would also be possible.)
Pain -- behavior can point to a painful place -- but the subject of pain is the person who gives it expression.
303. "I can only believe that someone else is in pain, but I know' it if I am." -- Yes: one can make the decision to say "I believe he is in pain" instead of "He is in pain". But that is all. What looks like an explanation here, or like a statement about a mental process, is in truth an exchange of one expression for another which, while we are doing philosophy, seems the more appropriate one.
Just try -- in a real case -- to doubt someone else's fear or pain.
304. "But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain -- behavior accompanied by pain and pain -- behavior without any pain?" -- Admit it? What greater difference could there be? -- "And yet you again and again reach the conclusion that the sensation itself is a nothing." -- Not at all. It is not a something, but not a nothing either! The conclusion was only that a nothing would serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be said. We have only rejected the grammar which tries to force itself on us here.
The paradox disappears only if we make a radical break with the idea that language always functions in one way, always serves the same purpose: to convey thoughts -- which may be about houses, pains, and evil, or anything else you please.
305. "But you surely cannot deny that, for example, in remembering, an inner process takes place." - - What gives the impression that we want to deny anything? When one says "Still, an inner process does take place here" -- one wants to go on: "After all, you see it." And it is this inner process that one means by the word "remembering". -- The impression that we wanted to deny
￼something arises from our setting our faces against the picture of the 'inner process'. What we deny is that the picture of the inner process gives us the correct idea of the use of the word "to remember". We say that this picture with its ramifications stands in the way of our seeing the use of the word as it is.
306. Why should I deny that there is a mental process? But "There has just taken place in me the mental process of remembering...." means nothing more than: "I have just remembered ....". To deny the mental process would mean to deny the remembering; to deny that anyone ever remembers anything.
307. "Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom really saying that everything except human behavior is a fiction?" -- If I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction.
308. How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states and about behaviorism arise? The first step is the one that altogether escapes notice. We talk of processes and states and leave their nature undecided. Sometime perhaps we shall know more about them -- we think. But that is just what commits us to a particular way of looking at the matter. For we have a definite concept of what it means to learn to know a process better. (The decisive movement in the conjuring trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought quite innocent.) -- And now the analogy which was to make us understand our thoughts falls to pieces. So we have to deny the yet uncomprehended process in the yet unexplored medium. And now it looks as if we had denied mental processes. And naturally we don't want to deny them.
309. What is your aim in philosophy? -- To show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.

￼Preface
This is a translation of the Tibetan text of Mulamadhyamakakii- rikii. lt is perhaps an odd idea to translate a Tibetan translation of a Sanskrit text and to retranslate a text of which there are four extant English versions. My reasons for doing so are these: First, I am not satisfied with any of the other English versions. Every translation, this one included, of any text embodies an interpreta- tion, and my interpretation differs in various respects from those of my predecessors in this endeavor. This is to be expected. As Tucl&lt; (1990) has correctly observed, Niigiirjuna, like any philosopher from a distant cultural context, is always read against an interpre- tive backdrop provided by the philosophical presuppositions of the interpreter, and by previous readings of Niigiirjuna. So I claim no special privileged position vis avis Streng (1967), lnada (1970), Sprung (1979), or Kalupahana (1986)-only a different position, one· that I hope will prove useful in bringing Mulamadhyama- kakiirikii into contemporary philosophical discourse. I, like any translator/interpreter must acknowledge that there is simply no fact of the matter about the correct rendering of any important and genuinely interesting text. lnterpretations, and with them, transla- tions, will continue to evolve as our understanding of the text evolves and as our interpretive horizon changes. Matters are even more complex and indeterminate when the translation crosses cen- turies, traditions and languages, and sets of philosophical assump- tions that are quite distant from one another, as is the case in the present project. So each of the available versions of the text em- bodies a reading. lnada reads Niigiirjuna from the standpoint of
￼viii Preface
the Zen tradition·, and his translation reftects thai reading; Kalu- pahana reads Nagarjuna as a Theravada commentator on the Kacciiyiinagotta-satra, and his translation reftects thai reading, as well as his view about the affinities between James's pragmatism and Theravada Buddhism. Sprung adoptsMurti's Kantian interpre- tation of Madhyamika, and his translation reftects that interpreta- tion. Streng reads the text as primarily concerned with religious phenomenology. There is no translation of this text into English, and no commentary on it, that specifically reftects an Indo-Tibetan Prasailgika-Madhyamika interpretation. Inasmuch as this is my own preferred way to read Nagarjuna, and the reading dominant in Tibetan and highly influential in Japanese and Chinese discus- sions of Ma/amadhyamakakiirikii, I believe that it is important to fili this lacuna in the English bibliography.
Having argued thai all translation involves some interpretation and, hence, that there is always some distance between an original text and a translation, however good and canonical that translation may be, it follows that Ma/amadhyamakakiirikii and dBu-ma rtsa- ba shes-rab differ, however close they may be and however canoni- cally the latter is treated. Since dBu-ma rtsa-ba shes-rab is the text read by and commented on by generations of Tibetan philoso- phers, I think that it is important that an English translation of this very text be available to the Western philosophical public. This text is hence worthy in its own right of translation inasmuch as it is the proper subject of the Tibetan philosophical literature I and others find so deep and fascinating.
This is not a critical scholarly edition of the text. lt is not philo- logical in intent; nor is it a discussion of the commentarial litera- ture on Nagarjuna's text. There is indeed a need for such a book, but that need will have to be filled by someone else. This is rather meant to be a presentation of a philosophical text to philosophers, and not an edition of the text for Buddhologists. If philosophers and students who read my book thereby gain an entrance into Nagarjuna's philosophy and see Ma/amadhyamakakiirikii, as inter- preted herein, as a text worthy of study and discussion, this work will have served its purpose. Since my intended audience is not Buddhologists, per se, but Western philosophers who are inter- ested in Buddhist philosophy, I have tried to balance standard
￼Preface ix
renderings of Buddhist terminology with more perspicuous contem- porary philosophical language. I am not      thai I have always made the right decisions or thai I have found the middle path between the extremes of Buddhological orthodoxy and Western
·revisionism. But thai is the aim.
I am also striving for thai elusive middle path between two other
extremes in translation: I am trying on the one hand to avoid the unreadable literalism of translations thai strive to provide a verba- tim repórt of the words used the original, regardless of whether that results in a comprehensible English tex!. But there is on the other hand the extreme represented by a translation written in lucid English prose purporting to be what the original author wou/d have written bad he been a twentieth-century philosopher writing in English, or one thai, in an attempt to convey what the text real/y means on some particular interpretation, is in fact not a translation of the original text, but a completely new book, bearing only a distant relation to the original. This hopelessly mixes the tasks of translation on the one hand and critical commentary on the other. Of course, as I have noted above, these tasks are inter- twined. But there is the fauli of allowing the translation to become so mixed with the commentary thai one no longer has a grip on, for example, what is Nagiirjuna and what is Garfield. After all, al- though the text is interpreted in being translated, .this text should stili come out in translation as a I.ext which cou/d be interpreted in the ways thai others have read it. Because the original does indeed justify competing interpretations. Thai is one of the things thai makes it such an important philosophical work.

￼Acknowledgments
Thanks are already due to many who have helped at different stages of this project: Thanks to Bob Thurman and David Sloss for first introducing me to Buddhist philosophy and then for encourag- ing me to wade deeper. Thanks to David Kalupahana, Steve Odin, Kenneth Inada, and Guy Newland, as well as to David Karnos, Joel Aubel, Dick Garner, and William Herbrechtsmeier for many hours of valuable and enjoyable discussion of this text at the Na- tional Endowment for the Humanities Sommer institute on Nagar- juna in Hawaii. And thanks to the NEH for the grant support that enabled my participation in that institute. I am especially gn1teful to Guy Newland for many subsequent conversations, useful sugges- tions, encouragement, and a critical reading of my work. Thanks to Janet Gyatso for countless hours of profitable and enjoyable philosophical conversation and for many useful and detailed criti- cisms and suggestions on this and other related work. Thanks to the Ven. Geshe Lobzang Tsetan for starting me in Tibetan, for much useful philosophical interchange, for teaching me an im- mense amount about Madhyamika, and for his close criticism of this text; to Georges Dreyfus (Geshe Sengye Samdup) for much useful advice and discussion; and to Joshua and Dianne Cutler and the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center of North America for hospi- tality. I      thank John Donne for detailed comments on several chapters of an earlier draft of this translation.
I am grateful to the lndo-American Foundation, the Council for the International Exchange of Scholars, and the Smithsonian Insti- tution for an Indo-American Fellowship in 1990-91. During that
￼xii Acknow/edgments
time, as a Visiting Senior Research Scholar at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, I began work on this project. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to The Most Ven. Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche and his staff for hosting me and my family at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and to Rinpoche himself for his generous personal help. I thank the Ven. Geshe Ngawang Sherab for all of his kind logistical help at Santarakshita Library and for friendship and philosophical interchange. Thanks also to the Ven. Lobzang Norbu Shastri and the Ven. Acarya Ngawang Samten for extensive conversations from which I learned much and for useful comments on this work and to Karma for Tibetan lessons.
I am deeply grateful to the Ven. Prof. Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas for reading dBu-ma rtsa-ba shes-rab and related texts with me and for giving me his invaluable      commentary on these texts during that year and on many subsequent occasions. Nobody has taught me more about Miidhyamika philosophy, and it is hard to imagine a more patient, generous, and incisive scholar and teacher. Without his lucid teachings, and without Geshe-la's enormous patience, I could never have approached this text with any degree of success. While he would not agree with everything I say, my own reading of this text is enormously influenced by his. Special thanks to Sri Yeshi Tashi Shastri for his translation and transcription assistance during many of these sessions and for an enormous amount of cheerful and generous         research assistance, including a great deal of care- ful proofreading and detailed comments on this translation.
During that year and in subsequent years I also benefited greatly from my visits to the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics. I am deeply grateful to the Ven. Prof. Geshe Lobzang Gyatso for his hospitality and for his teaching. In our many conversations and from his writ- ings I have learned a great deal, and this project certainly reflects his influence. Without his patient advice on interpretative and expository details and without his vigorous critique of many of my ideas it would have been impossible to produce this commentary. I thank the Ven. Sherab Gyatso for his tireless and invaluable trans- lation and assistance during that time. The Ven. Sherab Gyasto, The Ven. Graham Woodhouse, the Ven. Tenzin Dechen, and the Ven. Huen have given much to me in many hours of philosophical interchange through translation help and through their hospitality

and friendship. Mr. Phillipe Goldin has also offered many helpful suggestions on the translation and commentary. I also thank the Ven. Khamtrul Rinpoche, the Ven. Geshe Yeshe Topden (Gen Drup-Thop) and Gen Lam-Rim-pa for their teachings and Acarya Nyima Tshering for his introduction and translation on those occa- sions. Special thanks to Nyima Penthog for improving my Tibetan.
I thank His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his encouragement and for valuable discussion of some difficult interpretative issues.
I am also very grateful to friends and colleagues at Drepung Loseling Monastic College. My visit there was extremely enjoyable and also philosophically fruitful. Thanks to the Ven. Geshe Dak-pa Toepgyal and the Ven. Thupten Dorjee for arranging everything and for talking with me about this and other work. I am very grateful to the Ven. Geshe Namgyal Wangchen for detailed com- ments and encouragement on this work and for useful discussions about Miidhyamika, translation, the task of presenting Buddhist philosophical texts to the West, and other topics.
My acknowledg111ent of help in India would not be complete without acknowledging the gracious hospitality and assistance in living of Sri N. N. Rai, Sri Arun Kumar Rai, Sri A. R. Singh, and their families in Sarnath; the hospitality of Kunzom Topden Martam and his family in Sikkim-it was the Martam house in which the writing actually got started; and Dr. L. S. Suri of the American Institute of Indian Studies in New Delhi, whose adminis- trative efficiency kept everything moving smoothly.
I am deeply grateful to four friends who read a complete draft of this work and provided honest, searching, sometimes scathing criti- cism. What more could one ask from colleagues and friends? Many of their suggestions are incorporated in the book .as it now stands, and much of whatever is good init is due to theirenormous contribu- tions. Sometimes I have disagreed with each of them. And whatever errors remain are certainly my own. So thanks            to the Ven. Gareth Sparham, the Ven. Sherab Gyatso, Guy Newland, and Jane Braaten for copious corrections and criticism and for extensive pro- ductive discussion. Thanks also to Prof. Alan Sponberg for useful comments on an earlier draft and to Janet Gyatso, Graham Parkes, and Georges Dreyfus for reading and commenting on the penulti- mate draft.
￼xiv Acknow/edgments
Another group of colleagues to whom I owe thanks are those who kepi faith. This may require some explanation. I discovered when I-a Western, analytically trained philosopher of mind- began to work on Buddhist philosophy that many in philosophy and cognitive science took this as evidence of some kind of insan- ity, or at least as an abandonment of philosophy, per se. This is not · the place to speculate on the origins or nature of the stigma attach- ing in some parts of our profession to Asian philosophy. But il is a sad fact to be noted and to be rectified. In any case, I therefore owe special thanks to those who went out of their way to support this work and to let me know thai they look it and me seriously. I thank especially my friend and colleague Meredith Michaels for constant support, advice, and encouragement. And I thank Mur- ray Kiteley, John Connolly, Nalini Bhushan, Kathryn Addelson, Elizabeth Spellman, Frederique Marglin, Lee Bowie, Tom Warten- burg, Vere Chappell, Gareth Matthews, and John Robison, as well as Dan Lloyd, Steve Horst, and Joe Rouse. Thanks under this head also go to many of my nonphilosopher colleagues in the Hampshire College Cultural Studies program. I single out Mary Russo, Joan Landes, Susan Douglas, Jeffery Wallen, Norman Hol- land, and L. Brown Kennedy.
I also gratefully acknowledge the support of several Hewlett- Mellon faculty development grants from Hampshire College and thank the deans of the college for supporting this work so geoer- ously. I am also grateful for the support of this project and of related projects involving academic exchange between the Ameri- can and Tibetan academic communities from President Greg Prince of Hampshire College. Thanks also to Ms. Ruth Hammen and Ms. Leni Bowen for regular logistical support, to Mr. Andrew Janiak for his extensive assistance and editorial suggcstions in the       stages of manuscript preparation, and to Mr. Shua Garfield and Mr. Jeremy Mage foradditional assistance in manuscript prepa- ration and proofreading. Thanks as well to many groups of stu- dents in "Convention, Knowledge and Existence: European and Indo-Tibetan Perspectives" for putting up with and helping me to refine IDY presentation of this text and for my students in Buddhist Philosophy at Mount Holyoke College for working through an earlier draft of this text.

I am more grateful than I could ever express to my family for accompanying me to India for one year, for enduring my absence when I have been in India alone, and for enduring my preoccupa- tion with this and related philosophical projects. I am especially grateful to Blaine Garson, who has shouldered far more than her fair share of parenting and other household responsibilities. Every stage of this project is dependent upon her help, sacrifice, and support.
I hope that I haven't forgotten anybody.

￼Dedicatory Verses
I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,
The best of teachers, who taught that Whatever is dependently arisen is Unceasing, unbom,
Unannihilated, not perrnanent,
Not coming, not going,
Without distinction, without identity, And free from conceptual construction.

Chapter I Examination of Conditions
Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both,
Nor without a cause,
Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.
There are four conditions: efficient condition; Percept-object condition; immediate condition; Dominant condition, just so.
There is no fifth condition.
The essence of entities
Is not present in the conditions, etc . . . . If there is no essence,
There can be no otherness-essence.
Power to act does not have conditions.
There is no power to act without conditions. There are no conditions without power to act. Nor do any have the power to act.
These give rise to those,
So these are called conditions.
As long as those do not come from these, Why are these not non-conditions?

For neither an existent nor a non-existent thing Is a condition appropriate.
If a thing is non-existent, how could it have a
condition?
If a thing is already existent, what would a condition
do?
When neither existents nor
Non-existents nor existent non-existents are
established,
How could one propose a "productive cause?" If there were one, it would be pointless.
An existent entity (mental episode)
Has no object.
Since a mental episode is without an object, How could there beany percept-condition?
Since things are not arisen, . Cessation is not acceptable.
Therefore, an immediate condition is not reasonable. If something has ceased, how could it be a condition?
If things did not exist
Without essence,
The phrase, "When this exists so this will be," Would not be acceptable.
In the several or united conditions
The effect cannot be found.
How could something not in the conditions Come from the conditions?
However, if a nonexistent effect Arises from these conditions, Why does it not arise
From non-conditions?
￼Examination o f Condition 5
13. If the effect's essence is the conditions,
But the conditions don't have their own essence, How could an effect whose essence is the conditions Come from something that is essenceless?
14. Therefore, neither with conditions as their essence, Nor with non-conditions as their essence are there any
effects.
If there are no such effects,
How could conditions or non-conditions be evident?
￼Chapter II Examination of Motion
1. What has been moved is not moving.
What has not been moved is not moving.
Apart from what has been moved and what has not
been moved,
Movement cannot be conceived.
2. Where there is change, there is motion. Since there is change in the moving, And not in the moved or not-moved, Motion is in that which is moving.
3. How would it be acceptable For motion to be in the mover?
When it is not moving, it is not acceptable To call it a mover.
4. For whomever there is motion in the mover, There could be non-motion
Evident in the mover.
But having motion follows from being a mover.
5. If motion is in the mover,
There would have to be a twofold motion:
￼Examination ofMotion 7 One in virtue of which it is a mover,
And one in virtue of which it moves.
6. If there were a twofold motion,
The subject of that motion would be twofold. For without a subject of motion,
There cannot be motion.
7. If without a mover
It would not be correct to say that there is motion, Then if there were no motion,
How could there be a mover?
8. Inasmuch as a real mover does not move, And a non-mover does not move,
A part from a mover and a non-mover, What third thing could move?
9. When without motion,
It is unacceptable to call something a mover, How will it be acceptable
To say that a mover moves?
10. For bim from whose perspective a mover moves, There would be the consequence that
Without motion there could be a mover. Because a mover moves.
11. If a mover were to move,
There would be a twofold motion:
One in virtue of which he is a mover,
And one in virtue of which the mover moves.
12. Motion does not begin in what has moved, Nor does it begin in what has not moved, Nor does it begin in what is moving.
In what, then, does motion begin?

Prior to the beginning of motion,
There is no beginning of motion in
The going or in the gone.
How could there be motion in the not-gone?
Since the beginning of motion
Cannot be conceived in any way,
What gone thing, what going thing,
And what non-going thing can be posited?
Just as a moving thing is not stationary,
A non-moving thing is not staiionary.
Apart from the moving and the non-moving, What third thing is stationary?
I f without motion
li is not appropriate to posil a mover, How could it be appropriate to say Thai a moving thing is stationary?
One does not hall from moving,
Nor from having moved or not having moved. Motion and coming to rest
And starting to move are         
Thai motion just is the mover itself Is not correct.
Nor is it correct thai
They are completely different.
lt would        from
The identity of mover and motion Thai agent and action
Are identical.
li would        from
A real distinction between motion and mover Thai there could be a mover without motion And motion without a mover.
￼Examination ofMotion 9
21. When neither in identity Nor in difference
Can they be established,
How can these two be established at all?
22. The motion by means of which a mover is manifest Cannot be the motion by means of which he moves. He does not exist before that motion,
So what and where is the thing that moves?
23. A mover does not carry out a different motion
From that by means of which he is manifest as a mover. Moreover, in one mover
A twofold motion is unacceptable.
24. A really existent mover
Doesn't move in any of the three ways.
A non-existent mover
Doesn't move in any of the three ways.
25. Neither an entity nor a non-entity Moves in any of the three ways.
So motion, mover and
And route are non-existent.
￼Chapter III Examination of the Senses
1. Seeing,         smelling, Tasting, touching, and mind
Are the six sense faculties.
Their spheres are the visible objects, etc. . . .
2. That very seeing does not see ltself at all.
How can something that cannot see itself See another?
3. The example of fire Cannot elucidate seeing.
Along with the moved and not-moved and motion That has been answered.
4. When there is not even the slightest Nonseeing seer,
How could it makes sense to say That seeing sees?
5. Seeing itself does not see. Nonseeing itself does not see.
Through seeing itself
The elear analysis of the seer is understood.
￼Examination ofthe Senses li
6. Without detachment from vision there is no seer. Nor is there a seer detached from it.
If there is no seer
How can there be seeing or the seen?
7. Just as the birth of a son is said to occur
In dependence on the mother and father,
So consciousness is said to arise
In dependence on the eye and          form.
8. From the nonexistence of seeing and the seen it follows thai
The other four faculties of knowledge do not exist. And all the aggregates, etc„
Are the same way.
9. Like the seen, the heard, the smelled, The tasted, and the touched, .
The hearer, sound, etc.,
And consciousness should be understood.
￼Chapter IV Examination of the Aggregates
1. Apart from the cause of form, Form cannot be conceived.
Apart from form,
The cause of form is not seen.
2. If apart from the cause of form, there were form, Form       be without cause.
But nowhere is there an effect Without a      
3. If apart from form
There were a cause of form,
It would be a cause without an effect. But there are no causes without effects.
4. When form exists,
A cause of the arising of form is not tenable. When form is non-existent,
A eause of the arising of form is not tenable.
5. Form itself without a cause Is not possible or tenable.
Therefore, think about form, but
Do not construct theories about form.
￼Examinalion o f the Aggregates 13
6. The assertion that the effect and cause are similar Is not acceptable.
The assertion thai they are not similar Is also not acceptable.
7.           discriminations, and dispositions And consciousness and all such things Should be thought of
In the same way as          form.
8. When an analysis is made through emptiness, If someone were to offer a reply,
Thai reply will       since it will presuppose Exactly what is to be proven.
9. When an explanation is made through emptiness, Whoever would find fauli with it
Will find no fauli, since the criticism will presuppose Exactly what is to be proven.
￼ChapterV Examination of Elements
1. Prior to a characteristic of space There is not the           space.
If it arose prior to the characteristic
Theo it                  arise without a characteristic.
2. A thing without a characteristic Has never existed.
If nothing       a characteristic, Where do characteristics come to be?
3. Neither in the uncharacterized nor in the characterized Does a characteristic arise.
Nor does it arise
In something different from these two.
4. If characteristics do not appear,
Theo it is not         to posil the characterized object. If the characterized object is not posited,
There will be no characteristic either.
5. From this it follows that there is no characterized And no existing characteristic.
Nor is there any entity
Other than the characterized and the characteristic.
￼Examination o f Elements 15
6, If there is no existent thing,
Of what will there be nonexistence?
Apiirt from existent and nonexistent things Who knows existence and nonexistence?
7. Therefore, space is not an entity. It is not a nonentity.
Not               not without character. The same is true of the other live elements.
8. Fools and reificationists who perceive The existence and nonexistence
Of objects
Do not see the pacification of objectification.
￼ChapterVI
Examination of Desire and the Desirous
1. If prior to desire
And without desire there were a desirous one, Desire would depend on him.
Desire would exist when there is a desirous one.
2. Were there no desirous one, moreover, Where would desire occur?
Whether or not desire or the desirous one exist, The analysis would be the same.
3. Desire and the desirous one Cannot arise together.
In that case, desire and the desirous one Would not be          contihgent.
4. In identity there is no simultaneity.
A thing is not simultaneous with itself. But if there is difference,
Theo how would there be simultaneity?
￼5.
6.
7.

10.
If in identity there were simultaneity. Theo it could occur without association. If in difference there were simultaneity, It could occur without association.
If in difference there were simultaneity, How could desire and the desirous one, Being different, be established?
If they were, they would be simultaneous.
I f desire and the desirous one Are established as different, Theo why would you think That they are simultaneous?
Since difference is not established,
If you assert that they are simultaneous, Since they are established as simultaneous, Do you also assert that they are different?
Since nothing different has been established, If one is asserting simultaneity,
Which different thing
Do you want to say is simultaneous?
Tuus desire and the desirous one
Cannot be established as simultaneous or not
simultaneous.
So, like desire, nothing whatever
Can be established either as simultaneous or as
nonsimultaneous.
Examination of Desire and the Desirous 17
￼ChapterVII Examination of the Conditioned
1. I f        were produced,
Theo it would also have the three                
If arising is not produced,
How could the                of the produced exist?
2. If the three,         etc., are separate,
They cannot function as the                of the
produced.
But how could they be joined In one thing simultaneously?
3. I f         abiding, and ceasing
Have characteristics other than tho5e of the produced, There would be an infinite regress.

Examination ofthe Conditioned 19 How, according to you, does this,
Not arisen from the basie arising, give rise to that?
If, as you say, that which is arisen from basie        Gives     to the basis,
How does that          basis
Give     to it?
I f this         
Could give     to that,
Then, as you wish,
It will give rise to that which is arising.
Just as a butterlamp
Illuminates itself as well as others, So arising gives rise to itself
And to other       things.
In the butterlamp and its place,
There is no darkness.
What then does the butterlamp illuminate? For illumination is the         of darkness.
If the arising butterlamp
Does not reach darkness,
How could that arising butterlamp Have cleared the darkness?
If the illumination of darkness occurs Without the butterlamp reaching darkness, All of the darkness in the world
Should be illuminated.
If, when it is illuminated,
The butterlamp illuminates itself and others, Darkness should, without a doubt,
Conceal itself and others.

13. How     thisarising,beingnonarisen, Give rise to        
And if it is arisen from another,
Having arisen, what is the need for another arising?
14. The arisen, the nonarisen, and that which is arising Do not arise in any way at all.
Thus they        be understood
Just like the gone, the not-gone, and the going.
15. When there is arising but not yet That which is arising,
How can we say that that which is arising Depends on this arising?
16. Whatever is             arisen, Such a thing is essentially          
Therefore that which is arising and arising        Are                     
17. I f a nonarisen entity Anywhere exists,
That entity       have to arise.
But if it were nonexistent, what       arise?
18. I f this arising
Gave rise to that which is arising,
By means of what arising Does that arising arise?
19. If another arising gives rise to this one, There       be an infinite regress.
I f something nonarisen is arisen, Then all things couId arise in this way.

Examination ofthe Conditioned 21 As it is taught before with
"For neither an existent nor a nonexistent."
The arising of a ceasing thing Is not tenable.
But to say that it is not ceasing Is not tenable for anything.
A static existent does not endure.
A nonstatic existent does not endure. Stasis does not endure.
What nonarisen can endure?
The endurance of a ceasing entity Is not tenable.
But to say that it is not ceasing
Is not tenable for anything.
Inasmuch as the nature of all things Is aging and death,
Without aging and death,
What existents can endure?
Stasis cannot endure through itself Or through another stasis.
Just as arising cannot arise from itself Or from another arising.
The ceasing of what has ceased does not happen. What has not yet ceased does not cease.
Nor does that which is ceasing.
What nonarisen can cease?
The cessation of what is static Is not tenable..
Nor is the cessation of Something not static tenable.
￼22 THB TBXT OF MOLAMADHYAMAKAKARIKA
28. Being static does not cease Through being static itself.
Nor does being static cease
Through another instance of being static.
29. When the arising of any entity Is not tenable,
Then the cessation of any entity Is not tenable.
30. For an existent thing Cessation is not tenable.
A single thing being an entity and A nonentity is not tenable.
31. Moreover, for a nonentity, Cessation would be untenable.
Just as a second beheading Cannot be          
32. Cessation does not cease by means of itself. Nor does it cease by means of another.
Just as arising cannot arise from itself Or from another arising.
33. Since arising, ceasing, and abiding
Are not established, there are no compounded things. If all compounded things are unestablished,
How could the uncompounded be established?
34. Like a dream, like an illusion, Like a city of Gandharvas,
So have arising, abiding, And ceasing been explained.
￼Chapter VIII
Examination of the Agent and Action
1. This existent agent
Does not perfonn an existent action. Nor does some nonexistent agent Perform some nonexistent action.
2. An existent entity has no activity.
There would also be action without an agent. An existent entity has no activity.
There would also be agent without action.
3. If a nonexistent agent
Were to perform a nonexistent action, Then the action would be without a cause And the agent would be without a cause.
4. Without a cause, the effect and lts cause will not occur.
Without this, activity and
Agent and action are not possible.
￼24 THE TEXT OF MOLAMADHYAMAKAKARIKA
5. I f activity, etc., are not possible,
Entities and nonentities are not possible.
If there are neither entities nor nonentities, Effects cannot arise from them.
6. If there are no effects, liberation and Paths to higher realms will not exist. So all of activity
Would be without purpose.
7. A n existent and nonexistent agent
Does not perform an existent and nonexistent action. Existence and nonexistence cannot pertain to the same
thing.
For how could they exist together?
8. A n actual agent
Does not perform a nonactual action.
Nor by a nonactual one is an actual one performed. From this, all of those errors would follow.
9. A n existent agent
Does not perform an action that
Is unreal or both real and unreal As we have already agreed.
10. A nonexistent agent
Does not perform an action that
Is unreal or both real and unreal As we have already agreed.
11. A n existent and nonexistent agent does not perform an action that
Is unreal or both real and unreal As we have agreed.
￼Examination of the Agent and Action 25
12. Action depends upon the agent. The agent itself depends on action.
One cannot see any way
To establish them differently.
13. From this elimination of agent and action,
One should elucidate appropriation in the same way. Through action and agent
All remaining things should be understood.
￼Chapter IX Examination of the Prior Entity
1. Since sight and hearing, etc., and Feeling, etc„ exist,
He who has and uses them
Musi exist prior to those, some say.
2. If there were no existent thing, How could seeing, etc., arise?
lt follows from this that prior to this, there is an existent thing.
3. How is an entity existing prior to Seeing, hearing, etc., and
The felt, etc., ltself known?
4. If it can abide
Without the seen, etc.,
Then, without a doubt, They can abide without it.
5. Someone is disclosed by something. Something is disclosed by someone. Without something how can someone exist? Without someone how can something exist?
￼Examination ofthe Prior Entity 27
6. White prior to all of seeing, etc., That prior entity doesn't exist,
Through seeing, etc., by another one, That other one becomes disclosed.
7. lf prior to all of seeing, etc„ No prior entity exists,
How       an entity prior To each seeing exist?
8. If the seer        is the hearer itself,
And the feeler         at different limes,
Prior to each of these he       have to arise. But this makes no sense.
9. l f t h e s e e r        i s d i s t i n c t ,
The hearer is distinct and the feeler is distinct,
Then when there is a seer there            be a hearer, And there       have to be many        
10. Seeing and hearing, etc„ And feeling, etc.,
And thai from which ihese are arisen: There is no existent there.
11. Seeing and hearing, etc„ And feeling, etc„
lf that to which they        does not exist, they            do not exist.
12. For whomever prior to,
Simultaneous with, or after seeing, etc„ there is
nothing,
For such a one, assertions like "it exists" or "it does not
exist"-
Such conceptions will cease.
￼ChapterX Examination of Fire and Fuel
1. I f fuel were fire
Then agent and action would be one. If fire were different from fuel,
Then it could arise without fuel.
2. lt would be forever aflame;
Flames could be ignited without a cause.
lts beginning would be meaningless.
In that case, it would be without any action.
3. Since it would not depend on another Ignition would be without a cause.
If it were etemally in ftames, Starting it would be meaningless.
4. So, if one thinks thai
That which is buming is the fuel,
If it is jus! this,
How is this fuel being bumed?
5. If they are different, and if one not yet connected isn't connected,
The not yet burned will not be bumed.
￼Examination o f Fire and Fue/ 29 They will not cease. If they do not cease
Then it will persist with its own characteristic.
6. Just as a man and a woman
Connect to one another as man and woman,
So if fire were different from fuel,
Fire and fuel would have to be fit .for connection.
7. And, if fire and fuel Preclude each other,
Then fire being different from fuel,
It must stili be asserted that they connect.
8. If fire depends on fuel, And fuel depends on fire,
On what are fire and fuel established as dependent? Which one is established first?
9. If fire depends on fuel,
It would be the establishment of an established fire. And the fuel could be fuel
Without any fire.
10. If that on which an entity depends Is established on the basis
Of the entity depending on it,
What is established in dependence on what?
11. What entity is established through dependence? If it is not established, then how could it depend? However, if it is established merely through
dependence,
That dependence makes no sense.
12. Fire is not dependent upon fuel. Fire is not independent of fuel.
Fuel is not dependent upon fire. Fuel is not independent of fire.
￼30 THE TEXT OF MOL.4.M.4.DHYAM.4.KAKARIK..i
13. Fire does not come from something else, Nor is fire in fuel itself.
Moreover, fire and the rest are just like The moved, the not-moved, and the goer.
14. Fuel is not fire.
Fire does not arise from anything different from fuel. Fire does not possess fuel.
Fuel is not in fire, nor vice versa.
15. Through discussion of fire and fuel,
The self and the aggregates, the pot and cloth All together,
Without remainder have been explained.
16. I do not think that
Those who teach that the self
Is the same as or different from the entities Understand the meaning of the doctrine.
￼Chapter XI Examination of the lnitial and
      Limits
1. When asked about the beginning,
The Great Sage said that nothing is known of it. Cyclic existence is without end and beginning. So there is no beginning or end.
2. Where there is no beginning or end, How could there be a middle1
It follows that thinking about this in terms of
Prior, posterior, and simultaneous is not appropriate.
3. If birth carne first,
And then old age and death,
Theo birth would be ageless and deathless, And a deathless one would be bom.
4. If birth were to come after, And old age and death first,
How could there be a causeless aging and death Of one not bom?
￼32 THE TEXT OF M0LA.MADHYA.MA.KA.KA.RJKA.
5. Birth and age and death Cannot occur at one time.
Then what is being born would be dying And both would occur without cause.
6. When the series of the prior, simultaneous, and posterior
Is not possible,
Why are you led to posit This birth, aging, and death1
7. Not only is cyclic existence itself without beginning, No existent has a beginning:
Neither cause and effect;
Nor character and characterized . . .
8. Nor feeling and the feeler; Whatever there is:
All entities
Are without beginning.
￼ChapterXII Examination of Suffering
1. Some say suffering is self-produced,
Or produced from another or from both. Or that it arises without a cause.
It is not the kind of thing to be produced.
2. If suffering carne from itself,
Then it would not arise dependently.
For those aggregates
Arise in dependence on these aggregates.
3. If those were different from these, Or ifthese were different from those, Suffering could arise from another. These would arise from those others.
4.. If suffering were caused by a person himself, Then who is that person-
By whom suffering is caused- Who exists distinct from suffering?
5. If suffering comes from another person, Then who is that person-
When suffering is given by another- Who exists distinct from suffering?
￼34 m E TEXT OF MD'LAMADHYA.MAICAKAJUK..i
6. If another person causes           Who is that other one
Who bestowed that           Distinct from          
7. When             is not established,
How could suffering be caused by another? Whoever caused the          of another Must have caused his own          
8. No          is self-caused. Nothing causes itself.
If another is not self-made,
How could          be caused by another?
9. I f          were caused by each,          could be caused by both.
Not caused by self or by other, How could suffering be uncaused?
10. Not      does          not exist In any of the fourfold ways:
No extemal entity exists
In any ot the          ways.

The Victorious Conqueror has said that whatever Is deceptive is false.

I f whatever is deceptive is false,
What deceives?
The Victorious Conqueror has said about this That emptiness is completely true.
All things lack entitihood,
Since change is perceived.
There is nothing without entity Because all things have emptiness.
If there is no entitihood,
What changes?
If there were entity,
How could it be correct that something changes?

A thing itself does not change.
Something different does not change.
Because a young man doesn't grow old,
And because and an old man doesn't grow old either.
If a thing itself changed,
Milk itself would be curd.
Or curd would have come to be An entity different from milk.
If there were even a trifte nonempty, Emptiness itself would be but a trifte. But not even a trifte is nonempty. How could emptiness be an entity?
The victorious ones have said
That emptiness is the relinquishing of all views. For whomever emptiness is a view,
That one will accomplish nothing.
￼ChapterXIV Examination of Connection
1. The seen, seeing, and the seer: These three-pairwise or
All together-
Do not connect to one another.
2.           desire, the desirous one, the object of desire, And the remaining aftlictions
And the remaining sources of perception Are understood in this           way.
3. Since different things connect to one another, But in seeing, etc.,
There is no difference, They cannot connect.
4. Not      in seeing, etc.,
Is there no such difference:
When one thing and another are               It is      not         that there is difference.
5. A different thing depends on a different thing for its difference.
Without a different thing, a different thing          be different.
￼38 THE TEXT OF MD'LAMADHYAMAKAK.iRIK..i
lt is not         for that which depends on something     
To be different from it.
6. If a different thing were different from a different thing,
Without a different thing, a different thing       exist. But without that different thing, that different thing
does not exist.
lt         that it doesn't exist.
7. Difference is not in a different thing. Nor is it in a nondifferent thing.
If difference does not exist,
Neither different nor           things exist.
8. That does not connect to        
Nor do different things connect to one another. Neither connection nor
Connected nor connector exist.
￼Chapter:XV Examination of Essence
1. Essence arising from
Causes and conditions makes no sense.
If essence carne from causes and conditions, Theo it would be fabricated.
2. How could it be appropriate
For fabricated essence to come to be? Essence itself is not artificial
And does not depend on another.
3. If there is no essence,
How can there be difference in entities?
1
The essence of difference in entities
Is what is called the entity of difference.
4. Without having essence or othemess-essence, How can there be entities?
If there are essences and entities Entities are established.
5. If the entity is not established, A nonentity is not established.
An entity that has become different Is a nonentity, people say.
￼40 THE TEXT OF MtiLAMADHYAMAKAKARlti
6. Those who see essence and essential difference And entities and nonentities,
They do not see
The truth taught by the Buddha.
7. The Victorious One, through knowledge Of reality and unreality,
In the Discourse to Katyiiyiina, Refuted both "it is" and "it is not."
8. I f existence were through essence, Then there would be no nonexistence. A change in essence
Could never be tenable.
9. If there is no essence, What could become other?
If there is essence,
What could become other?
10. To say "it is" is to grasp for permanence.
To say "it is not" is to adopt the view of nihilism. Therefore a wise person
Does not say "exists" or "does not exist."
11. "Whatever exists through its essence
Cannot be nonexisten-t" is etemalism.
"It existed before but doesn't now" Entails the error of nihilism.
￼ChapterXVI Examination of Bondage
1. If compounded phenomena transmigrate,
They do not transmigrate as permanent.
If they are impermanent they do not transmigrate. The same approach applies to sentient beings.
2. I f someone transmigrates,
Then if, when sought in the fivefold way
In the aggregates and in the sense spheres and in the
elements,
He is not there, what transmigrates?
3. If one transmigrates from grasping to grasping, then One would be nonexistent.
Neither existent nor grasping, Who could this transmigrator be?
4. How could compounded phenomena pass into nirviir:ia? That would not be tenable.
How could a sentient being pass into nirvar:ia? That would not be tenable.
5. All compounded phenomena, as arising and ceasing things,
Are not bound and not released.
￼42 THE TEXT OF MO'LAMADHYAMA.KA.K..\RIKA For this reason a sentient being
Is not bound, not released.
6. I f grasping were bondage,
Then the one who is grasping would not be bound. But one who is not grasping is not bound.
In what circurnstances will one be bound?
7. If prior to binding There is a bound one,
There would be bondage, but there isn't.
The rest has been explained by the gone, the not-gone,
and the goer.
8. Whoever is bound is not released.
Whoever is not bound does not get released.
If a bound one were being released,
Bondage and release would occur sirnultaneously.
9. "I, without grasping, will pass beyond sorrow, And I will attain nirvar:ia," one says. Whoever grasps like this
Has a great grasping.
10. When you can't bring about nirvar:ia, Nor the purification of cyclic existence,
What is cyclic existence,
And what is the nirvar:ia you exarnine?
￼Chapter XVII
Examination of Actions and Their Fruits
1. Self-restraint and benefiting others
With a compassionate mind is the Dharma. This is the seed for
Fruits in this and future lives.
2. The Unsurpassed Sage has said
That actions are either intention or intentional. The varieties of these actions
Ha".e been announced in many ways.
3. Of these, what is called "intention" Is mental desire.
What is called "intentional" Comprises the physical and verbal.
4. Speech and action and all
Kinds of unabandoned and abandoned actions, And resolve
As well as ...
￼44 THE TEXT OF M0LA.MADHYA.MAKAKA'JUK..i
5. Virtuous·and nonvirtuous actions Derived from pleasure,
As well as intention and morality: Thcse seven are the kinds of action.
6. If until the time of ripening
Action bad to remain in place, it would have to be
permanent.
If it has ceased, then having ceased, How will a fruit arise?
7. As for a continuum, such as the sprout, It comes from a seed.
From that arises the fruit. Without a seed, It would not come into being.
8. Since from the seed comes the continuum, and from the continuum comes the fruit, The seed precedes the fruit.
Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor
permanence.
9. So, in a mental continuum, From a preceding intention
A consequent mental state arises. Without tltis, it would not arise.
10. Since from the intention comes the continuum, And from the continuum the fruit arises, Action precedes the fruit.
Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor
permanence.
11. The ten pure paths of action
Are the method of realizing the Dharma.
These fruits of the Dharma in this and other lives Are the five pleasures.
￼Examinanon ofActions and Their Fruils 45
12. I f such an analysis were advanced, There would be many great errors.
Therefore, this analysis Is not tenable here.
13. I will then explain what is tenable here: The analysis propounded by all
Buddhas, self-conquerors
And disciples according to which . . .
14. Action is like an uncancelled promissory note And like a debt.
Of the realms it is fourfold. Moreover, its nature is neutral.
15. By abandoning, that is not abandoned. Abandonment occurs through meditation. Therefore, through the nonexpired,
The fruit of action arises.
16. If abandonment occurred through abandoning, and Ifaction were destroyed through transformation, The destruction of action, etc.,
And other errors would arise.
17. From all these actions in a realm, Whether similar or dissimilar,
At the moment of birth Only one will arise.
18. In this visible world,
All actions ohhe two kinds,
Each comprising action and the unexpired separately, Will remain while ripening.
19. That fruit, if extinction or death
Occurs, ceases.
￼46 m E TEXT OF MiTLAMADHYA.MAKAKARIKA Regarding this, a distinction between the stainless
And the stained is drawn.
20. Emptiness and nonannihilation; Cyclic existence and nonpermanence:
Thai action is            Is taught by the Buddha.
21. Because action does not       li is seen to be without essence.
Because it is not arisen,
li follows thai it is nonexpiring.
22. I f action had an essence,
li would, without doubt, be etemal.
Action would be uncreated.
Because there can be no creation of what is etemal.
23. I f an action were uncreated,
Fear would      of             something not done. And the error of not preserving
One's vows would      
24. All conventions would then
Be contradicted, without doubt.
li would be impossible to draw a distinction Between virtue and evil.
25. Whatever is mature would mature Time and time again.
If there were essence, this would follow, Because action would remain in place.
26. While this action has afftiction as its nature This afftiction is not real in itself.
If afftiction is not in itself,
How can action be real in itself?

Action and aftliction
Are taught to be the conditions that produce bodies. If action and aftliction
Are empty, what would one say about bodies?
Obstructed by ignorance,
And consumed by passion, the experiencer Is neither different from the agent
Nor identical with it.
Since this action
Is not arisen from a condition, Nor arisen             
It follows that there is no agent.
If there is no action and agent, Where couId the fruit of action be? Without a fruit,
Where is there an experiencer?
Just as the teacher, by magie, Makes a magical           and By that         
Another illusion is created,
In that way are an agent and his action: The agent is like the illusion.
The action
Is like the illusion's          
Aftlictions, actions, bodies, Agents and fruits are
Like a city of Gandharvas and Like a mirage or a dream.
Examination ofActions and Their Fruits 47
￼Chapter XVIII Examination of Self and Entities
1. If the self were the aggregates,
li would have arising and ceasing (as properties).
If it were different from the aggregates,
li would not have the characteristics of the aggregates.
2. If there were no self,
Where would the self's (properties) be?
From the pacification of the self and what belongs to it, One abstains from grasping onto "!" and "mine."
3. One who does not grasp onto ''I'' and "mine," Thai one does not exist.
One who does not grasp onto "!"and "mine," He does not perceive.
4. When views of ''I" and ''mine" are extinguished,
Whether with respect to the interna! or extemal, The appropriator ceases.
This having ceased, birth ceases.
5. Action and misery having ceased, there is nirvii1,1a. Action and misery come from conceptual thought. This comes from mental fabrication.
Fabrication ceases through emptiness.

That there is a self has been taught, And the doctrine of no-self,
By the buddhas, as well as the Doctrine of neither self nor nonself.
What language expresses is nonexistent. The sphere of thought is nonexistent. Unarisen and unceased, like nirviil)a
Is the nature of things.
Everything is real and is not real, Both real and not real,
Neither real nor not real.
This is Lord Buddha's teaching.
Not dependent on another, peaceful and Not fabricated by mental fabrication,
Not thought, without distinctions,
That is the character of reality (that-ness).
Whatever comes into being dependent on another Is not identical to that thing.
Nor is it different from it.
Therefore it is neither nonexistent in time nor
permanent.
By the buddhas, patrons of the world, This immortal truth is taught:
Without identity, without distinction; Not nonexistent in time, not permanent.
When the fully enlightened ones do not appear, And when the disciples have disappeared,
The wisdom of the self-enlightened ones ,
Will arise completely without a teacher.

7. If the effect were to arise Simultaneously with the collection, Then the produced and the producer Would arise simultaneously.
8. U the effect were to arise Prior to the combination,
Then, without causes and conditions, The effect would arise causelessly.
9. If, the cause having ceased, the effect
Were a complete transformation of the cause, Then a previously arisen cause
Would arise again.
10. How can a cause, having ceased and dissolved, Give rise to a produced effect?
How can a cause joined with its effect produce it If they persist together?
11. Moreover, 'ii not joined with its cause, What effect can be made to arise?
Neither scen nor unseen by causes Are effects produced.
12. There is never a simultaneous connection Of a past effect
With a past, a nonarisen, Or an arisen cause.

There is never a simultaneous connection Of an arisen effect
With a past, a nonarisen,
Or an arisen cause.
There is never a simultaneous connection
Of a nonarisen effect
· With a past, a nonarisen,
Or an arisen cause.
Without connecting,
How can a cause produce an effect? Where there is connection,
How can a cause produce an effect?
If the cause is empty of an effect, How can it produce an effect?
If the cause is not empty of an effect, How can it produce an effect?
A nonempty effect does not arise. The nonempty would not cease. This nonempty would be
The nonceased and the nonarisen.
How can the empty arise?
How can the empty cease?
The empty will hence also
Be the nonceased and nonarisen.
For cause and effect to be identical Is not tenable.
For cause and effect to be different Is not tenable.
I f cause and effect were identical, Produced and producer would be identical.
￼Examination ofCombination 55 If cause and effect were different,
Cause and non-cause would be. alike.
21. If an effect bad entitihood,
What could have caused it to arise?
If an effect bad no entitihood, What could have caused it to arise?
22. If something is not producing an effect, It is not tenable to attribute causality.
If it is not tenable to attribute causality, Then of what will the effect be?
23. If the combination
Of causes and conditions
Is not self-produced,
How does it produce an effect?
24. Therefore, not made by combination,
And not without a combination can the effect arise. If there is no effect,
Where can there be a combination of conditions?

Examination of Becoming and Destruction
1. Destruction does not occur without becoming. It does not occur together with it.
Becoming does not occur without destruction. It does not occur together with it..
2. How could there be destruction Without becoming?
How could there be death without birth? There is no destruction without becoming.
3. How couId destruction and becoming Occur simultaneously?
Death and birth
Do not occur simultaneously.
4. How could there be becoming Without destruction?
For impermanence
Is never absent from entities.

How could destruction

Do not occur simultaneously.
How, when things cannot
Be established as existing,
With, or apart from one another, Can they be established at all?
There is no becoming of the disappeared. There is no becoming of the nondisappeared. There is no destruction of the disappeared. There is no destruction of the nondisappeared.
When no entities exist,
There is no becoming or destruction. Without becoming and destruction, There are no existent entities.
lt is not tenable for the empty
To become or to be destroyed.
lt is not tenable for the nonempty To become or to be destroyed.
lt is not tenable
That destruction and becoming are identical. lt is not tenable
Thai destruction and becoming are different.
If you think you see both
Destruction and becoming,
Then you see destruction and becoming Through impaired vision.
An entity does not arise from an entity.
An entity does not arise from a nonentity.
A nonentity does not arise from a nonentity. A nonentity does not arise from an entity.

An entity does not      from        
It is not       from another.
It is not       from        and another. How can it be       
If one accepts the existence of entities, Permanence and the view of          nonexistence
follow.
For these entities
Must be both permanent and impermanent.
If one accepts the existence of entities Nonexistence and permanence will not follow. Cyclic existence is the continuous
Becoming and destruction of causes and effects.
If cyclic existence is the continuous
Becoming and destruction ofcauses and effects, Then from the           of the destroyed Follows the nonexistence of cause.
If entities exist with entitihood,
Then their nonexistence       make no sense. But at the time of nirval)a,
Cyclic existence ceases             having been
pacified.
I f the       one has ceased,
The existence of a first one makes no sense. If the       one has not ceased,
The existence of a first one makes no sense.
If when the       one was ceasing, Then the first was        
The one ceasing       be one. The one              be another.
￼Examination of Becoming and Destruction 59
20. If, absurdly, the one arising
And the one ceasing were the same,
Then whoever is dying with the aggregates Is also arising.
21. Since the series of cyclic existence is not evident In the three times,
If it is not in the three times,
How could there be a series of cyclic existence?
￼Chapter XXII Examination of the Tathagata
1. Neither the aggregates, nor different from the aggregates,
The aggregates are not in bim, nor is he in the aggregates.
The Tathiigata does not possess the aggregates. What is the Tathiigata?
2. If the Buddha depended on the aggregates,
He would not exist through an essence.
Not existing through an essence,
How could he exist through otherness-essence?
3. Whatever is dependent on another entity, Its selfhood is not appropriate.
It is not tenable that what lacks a self Could be a Tathiigata.
4. If there is no essence,
How could there be otherness-essence?
Without possessing essence or otherness-essence, What is the Tathiigata?
￼Examination ofthe Tathagata 61
5. If without depending on the aggregates There were a Tathiigata,
Then now he would be depending on them. Therefore he would exist through dependence.
6. Inasmuch as there is no Tathiigata Dependent upon the aggregates,
How could something that is not dependent Come to be so?
7. There is no appropriation. There is no appropriator.
Without appropriation
How can there be a Tathiigata?
8. Having been sought in the fivefold way, What, being neither identical nor different, Can be thought to be the Tathiigata Through grasping?
9. Whatever grasping there is Does not exist through essence.
And when something does not exist through itself, lt can never exist through otherness-essence.
10. Tuus grasping and grasper
Together are empty in every respect.
How can an empty Tathiigata Be known through the empty?
11. "Empty" should not be asserted. "Nonempty" should.not be asserted.
Neither both nor neither should be asserted. They are only used nominally.
12. How can the tetralemma of permanent and
impermanent, etc.,
Be true of the peaceful?

How can the tetralemma of finite, infinite, etc., Be true of the peaceful?
One who grasps the view that the Tathagata exists, Aaving seized the Buddha,
Constructs conceptual fabrications
About one who has achieved nirvai;ia.
Since he is by nature empty, The thought that the Buddha Exists or does not exist
After nirviii;ia is not appropriate.
Those who develop mental fabrications with regard to the Buddha,
Who has gone beyond all fabrications,
As a consequence of those cognitive fabrications, Fail to see the Tatbiigata.
Whatever is the essence of the Tathiigata, That is the essence of the world.
The Tathagata has no essence.
The world is without essence.
￼Chapter XXIII Examination of Errors
1. Desire, hatred and confusion all Arise from thought, it is said.
They all depend on
The pleasant, the unpleasant, and errors.
2. Since whatever depends on the pleasant and the unpleasant
Does not exist through an essence, The defilements
Do not really exist.
3. The self's existence or nonexistence Has in no way been established.
Without that, how could the defilements' Existence or nonexistence be established?
4. The defilements are somebody's.
But that one has not been established. Without that possessor,
The defilements are nobody's.
5. View the defilements as you view your self: They are not in the defiled in the fivefold way.
￼64 THE TEXT OF M0LAMA.DHYAMA.KA.KARIKA View the defiled as you view your self:
It is not in the defilements in the fivefold way.
6. The pleasant, the unpleasant, and the errors Do not exist through essence.
Which pleasant, unpleasant, and errors could the defilements depend upon?
7. Form, sound, taste, touch,
Smeli, and concepts of things: These six Are thought of as the foundation of Desire, hatred, and confusion.
8. Form, sound, taste, touch,
Smeli, and concepts of things: These six
Should be seen as only like a city of the Gandharvas
and
Like a mirage or a dream.
9. How could the
Pleasant and unpleasant arise
In those that are like an illusory person And like a reftection?
10. We say that the unpleasant
Is dependent upon the pleasant,
Since         depending on the pleasant there is none. It follows that the pleasant is not tenable.
11. We say that the pleasant
Is dependent upon the unpleasant.
Without the unpleasant there wouldn't be any. It follows that the unpleasant is not tenable.
12. Where there is no pleasant, How can there be desire?
Where there is no unpleasant, How can there be anger?
￼Examination of Errors 65
13. If to grasp onto the view
'"The impermanent is permanent" were an error, Since in emptiness there is nothing impermanent, How i:ould thai grasping be an error?
14. If to grasp ont9 the view
'"The impermanent is permanent'' were an error,
Why isn't grasping onto the view
"In emptiness there is nothing impermanent" an error?
15. That by means of whieh there is grasping, and the grasping,
And the grasper, and all that is grasped: All are being relieved.
It follows thai there is no grasping.
16. I f there is no grasping,
Whether erroneous or otherwise,
Who will come to be in error? Who will have no error?
17. Error does not develop In one who is in error.
Error does not develop
In one who is not in error.
18. Error does not develop
In one in whom error is        
In whom does error develop? Examine this on your own!
19. I f e r r o r i s n o t       
How could it come to exist?
If error has not        How could one be in error?
20. Since an entity does not      from itself, Nor from another,
￼66

Nor from another and from itself, How could one be in errorr
If the self and the pure,
The permanent and the blissful existed, The self, the pure, the permanent,
And the blissful would not be deceptive.
If the self and the pure,
The permanent and the blissful did not exist, The nonself, the impure, the permanent, And suffering would not exist.
Thus, through the cessation of error lgnorance ceases.
When ignorance ceases
The compounded phenomena, etc„ cease.
If someone's defilements
Existed through his essence,
How could they be relinquished? Who could relinquish the existent?
If someone's defilements
Did not exist through his essence, How could they be relinquished?
Who could relinquish the nonexistent?
￼Chapter XXIV
Examination of the Four Noble Truths
1. If, all of this is empty, Neither arising nor ceasing,
Then for you, it follows that
The Four Noble Truths do not exist.
2. If the Four Noble Truths do not exist, Then knowledge, abandonment,
Meditation and manifestation Will be completely impossible.
3. If these things do not exist, The four fruits will not arise.
Without the four fruits, there will be no attainers of the fruits.
Nor will there be the faithful.
4. If so, the spiritual community will not exist. Nor will the eight kinds of person.
If the Four Noble Truths do not exist, There will be no true Dharma.
￼68 THB TBXT OF MliUMADHYAMAKAK..\IUKA
5. If there is no doctrine and           community, How can there be a Buddha?
If emptiness is conceived in this way, The three jewels are contradicted.
6. Hence you assert thai there are no real fruits. And no Dharma. The Dharma itself
And the conventional truth
Will be contradicted.
7. We say thai this understanding of yours
Of emptiness and the purpose of emptiness
And of the significance of emptiness is incorrect. As a consequence you are harmed by it.
8. The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma Is based on two truths:
A truth of worldly convention And an ultimate truth.
9. Those who do not understand
The distinction drawn between these two truths Do not understand
The Buddha's profound truth.
10. Without a foundation in the              truth,
The significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, Liberation is not achieved.
11. By a misperception of emptiness
A person of little intelligence is destroyed. Like a snake incorrectly seized
Or like a spell incorrectly cast.
12. For thai reason-that the Dharma is
Deep and difficult to understand and to leam- The Buddha's mind despaired of
Being able to teach it.

For bim to whom emptiness is not elear, Nothing becomes elear.
When you foist on us
All of your errors
You are like a man who has mounted his horse And has forgotten that very horse.
If you perceive the existence of all things
In terms of their essence,
Then this perception of all things
Will be without the            of causes and
conditions.
Effects and causes
And agent and action
And conditions and        and ceasing And effects will be rendered impossible.
Whatever is dependently          That is explained to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, Is itself the middle way.
Something that is not dependently        Such a thing does not exist.
Therefore a nonempty thing
Does not exist.

If all this were nonempty, as in your view, There would be no arising and ceasing. Theo the Four Noble Truths
Would become nonexistent.
U it is not dependently arisen,
How could suffering come to be?
Suffering has been taught to be impermanent, And so cannot come from its own essence.
If something comes from its own essence, How could it ever be       
It follows thai if one denies emptiness There can be no arising (of suffering).
If suffering had an essence, lts cessation would not exist. So if an essence is posited, One denies cessation.
U the path had an essence, Cultivation would not be appropriate. If this path is indeed cultivated,
lt cannot have an essence.
I f suffering, arising, and
Ceasing are nonexistent,
By what path could one seek
T o obtain the cessation of suffering?
I f nonunderstanding comes to be Through its essence,
How will understanding arise? Isn't essence stable?

Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 71 And the four fruits
Would not be possible.
For an essentialist,
Since the fruits through their essence Are already unrealized,
In what way could one attain them?
Without the fruits, there are no attainers of the fruits, Or enterers. From this it follows thai
The eight kinds of persons do not exist.
lf these don't exist, there is no spiritual community.
From the nonexistence of the Noble Truths
Would follow the nonexistence of the true doctrine. lf there is no doctrine and no spiritual community, How could a Buddha arise?
For you, it would foliow thai a Buddha Arises independent of enlightenment. And for you, enlightenment would arise Independent of a Buddha.
For you, one who through his essence
Was unenlightened,
Even by practicing the path to enlightenment Could not achieve enlightenment.
Moreover, one could never perform
Right or wrong actions.
lf this were all nonempty what could one do? That with an essence cannot be produced.
For you, from neither right nor wrong actions Would the fruit arise.
lf the fruit arose from right or wrong actions, According to you, it wouldn't exist.
￼72 THE TEXT OF MiiLAMADHYAMAKAtiRIK.i
35. lf, for you, a fruit arose Prom right or wrong actions,
Theo, having arisen from right or wrong actions, How could that fruit be nonempty?
36. If dependent arising is denied, Emptiness itself is rejected.
This would contradict
All of the worldly conventions.
37. l f emptiness itself is rejected, No action will be appropriate.
There would be action which did not begin, And there would be agent without action.
38. l f there is essence, the, whole world Will be unarising, unceasing,
And static. The entire phenomenal world Would be immutable.
39. lf it (the world) were not empty, Theo action would be without profit.
The act of ending suffering and
Abandoning misery and defilement would not exist.

And its arising
And its cessation as well as the path.

Unrelinquished, unattained, Unannihilated, not permanent, Unarisen, unceased:
This is how nirvat;1a is described.
Nirvat;1a is not existent.
lt would then have the characteristics of age and death. There is no existent entity

That, when it is not dependent and changing, Is taught to be nirvii.l)a.
10. The teacher has spoken of               Becoming and

If the existent and the nonexistent were established, This would be established.
16. I f nirvar;ia is

Then by whom is it expounded "Neither existent nor nonexistent"?
17. Having passed into nirvar;ia, the Victorious Conqueror Is neither said to be existent

Once consciousness has entered transmigration, Name and form come to be.
3. Once name and form come to be,
The six sense spheres come into being. Depending on the six sense spheres, Contact comes inio being.
4. Thai is only dependent
On eye and form and apprehension. Tuus, depending on name and form, And which produces consciousness-

Is contact. From contact Feeling comes to be.

Wben it appears, there is grasping, The four spheres of grasping.
7. When there is grasping, the grasper Comes into existence.
If he did not grasp,
Theo being.freed, he would not come into existence.
8. This existence is also the live aggregates. From existence comes birth,
Old age and death and misery and          and grief and . . .
9. Confusion and agitation.
All these      as a consequence of birth. Tuus this entire mass of         
Comes into being.
10. The root of cyclic existence is action. Therefore, the wise one does not act.
Therefore, the unwise is the agent.
The wise one is not because of his insight.

A continuum would not be tenable.

The Text and Commentary
￼
￼lntroduction to the Commentary
Nagarjuna, who lived in South lndia in approximately the second century C.E., is undoubtedly the most important, inftuential, and widely studied Mahayana Buddhist philosopher. He is the founder of the Madhyamika, or Middle Path schools of Mahayana Bud- dhism. His considerable corpus includes texts addressed to lay audi- ences, letters of advice to kings, and the set of penetrating meta- physical and epistemological treatises that represent the foundation of the highly sceptical and dialectical analytic philosophical school known as Miidhyamika. Most important of these is his largest and best known text, MUlamadhyamakakiirikii (literally Fundamental Verses on the.Middle Way). This text in turn inspires a huge com- mentarial literature in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Korean and Japa- nese. Divergences on interpretation of Mii/amadhyamakakiirikii of- ten determine the splits between major philosophical schools. So, for instance, the distinction between two of the three major Mahayana philosophical schools, Svatantrika-Miidhyamika and Prasat\gika-Madhyamika reftect, inter alia, distinct readings of this text, itself taken as fundamental by scholars within each of these schools. 1
The treatise itself is composed in very terse, often cryptic verses, with much of the explicit argument suppressed, generating signifi- cant interpretive challenges. But the uniformity of the philosophi- cal methodology and the clarity of the         philosophical vision

￼88 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
expressed in the text together provide a considerable fulcrum for exegesis. Moreover, the rich commentarial literature generates a number of distinct and illuminating readings. The central topie of the text is emptiness-the Buddhist technical term for the lack of independent existence, inherent existence, or essence in things. Nii.gii.rjuna relentlessly analyzes phenomena or processes that ap- pear to exist independently and argues that they cannot so exist, and yet, though lacking the          existence imputed to them either by naive common sense or by sophisticated realistic philo- sophical theory,2 these phenomena are not nonexistent-they are, he argues, conventionally real.
This dual thesis of the conventional reality of phenomena to- gether with their lack of inherent existence depends upon the com- plex doctrine of the two truths or two realities-a conventional or         truth and an ultimate truth-and upon a subtle and sur- prising doctrine regarding their relation. lt is, in fact, this sophisti- cated development of the doctrine of the two truths as a vehicle for understanding Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology that is Nii.gii.rjuna's greatest philosophical contribution. If the analysis in terms of emptiness is tbe substantive heart of Ma/amadhyamaka- kiirikii, the method of reductio ad absurdum is the methodological core. Nii.gii.rjuna, like Wes\ern sceptics, systematically eschews the defense of positive metaphysical doctrines regarding the nature of things, arguing rather that any such positive thesis is incoherent and that, in the end, our conventions and our conceptual frame- work can never be justified by demonstrating their correspondence
2. It cannot be overemphasized that as far as Nagarjuna-or any Mahayana Buddhist phi1osopher, for that matter-is concemed, the view that the things we perceive and of which we c-onceive, to the extent that they exist at all, do so inherently originates as an innate misapprehension and is not the product of sophis- ticated philosophical theory. That is, we naively and pretheoretically take things as substantial. This, as Niigiirjuna will argue, and as the Buddha himself argued, is the root delusion that lies at the basis of all human suffering. We can, to be sure, make sophisticated philosophy out of this. And much of Westem and Asian metaphysics is devoted to that enterprise. But it is important to see that an intellectual rejection of that sophisticated essentialist metaphysics would not, from the standpoint of Buddhism, suffice for            from suffering. For the innate misapprehension- the root delusion enshrined in common sense and in much of our language-would remain.· Nagarjuna's text is aimed primarily against philosophy. But its soterio- logical goal is the extirpation of the very root of suffering.
￼lntroduction to the Commentary 89
to an independent reality. Rather, he suggests, what counts as real depends precisely on our conventions.3
For Niigiirjuna and his followers this point is connected deeply and directly with the emptiness of phenomena. That is, for in- stance, when a Madhyamika philosopher says of a table thai it is empty, thai assertion by itself is incomplete. li invites the question, Empty of what? And the answer is, Empty of inherent existence, or self-nature, or, in more Western terms, essence.4 NoW, to say thai the table is empty is hence simply to say thai it lacks essence and importantly not to say thai it is completely nonexistent.' To say thai it lacks essence, the Miidhyamika philosopher will explain, is to say, as the Tibetans like to put it, thai it does not exist "from its owo side"-that its existence as the object thai it is-as a table- depends not on il, nor on any purely nonrelational characteristics, but depends on us as·well. Thai is, if our culture bad not evolved this manner of furniture, what appears to us to be an obviously unitary object might instead be correctly described as five objects:
3. Though in the end, as we shall see, ultimate reality depends on our conven- tions in a way, it depends on our conventions in a very different way from that in which conventional reality does. Despite this difference in the structure of the relation between convention and reality in the two cases, however, it remains a distinctive feature of N8g8rjuna's system that it is impossible to speak coherently of reality independent of conventions.
4. I have generally translated the Tibetan "rang bzhin" (Skt: svabhciva) with the English philosophical term "essence," as opposed to the more traditional "self- nature" or "own-being" used by many Buddhologists. (Here I agree with Cabezon (1992].) I think that this best captures NigirJuna's usage, and this choice makes good etymological sense as well. But there are dangers here. "Rang bzhin" and "svabhiiva" have their semantic homes in Buddhist philosophical literatuie, and their ordinary meanings derive from their usage in that environment. "Essence" has il semantic home in the Western philosophical tradition. So there will no doubt be resonances of the originaJ terms that are not captured by the transJation and new resonances introduced that would be foreign to the original text. But this is unavoid- able in a translation. Retaining the original term is worse, as it conveys nothing to the reader not already conversant with Tibetan, Sanskrit, and Buddhist philosophy. And using one of the ugly neologisms frequently introduced conveys the misleading impression that the original introduces such an ugly neologism. In the interest of not cluttering this text with philoIOgical footnotes, I will not generally defend my choices as I do here. But I do remind the reader of this and of any translation: Caveat lector! A great deal of interpretation goes into any translation.
5. See also Ng (1993), esp. pp. 12-15, for a good exposition. For an exposition of the contrary view, see Wood (1994). As will be elear, I disagree with his interpre- tation globally and on many points of detail.
￼90 THE TEXT A.ND COMMENTAllY
four quite useful sticks absurdly surmounted by a pointless slab of stick-wood waiting to be carved. Or we would have no reason to indicate this particular temporary arrangement of this matter as an object at all, as opposed to a brief intersection of the histories of some trees. lt is also to say that the table depends for its existence on its parts, on its causes, on its           and so forth. Apart from these, there is no table. The table, we might say, is a purely arbi- trary slice of space-time chosen by us as the referent of a single name and not an entity demanding, on its own, recognition and a philosophical analysis to reveal its essence. That independent char- acter is precisely what it lacks on this view.6
So from the standpoint of Madhyamika philosophy, when we ask of a phenomenon, Does it exist?, we must always pay careful atten- tion to the sense of the word "exist" that is at work. We might mean exist inherently, that is, in virtue of being a substance independent of its attributes, in virtue of having an essence, and so forth, or we might mean exist conventionally, that is to exist dependently, to be the conventional referent of a term, but not to have any indepen- dent existence. No phenomenon, Nagarjuna will argue, exists in the first sense. But that does nolentail that all phenomena are nonexis- tent tout court. Rather, to the degree that anything exists, it exists in the latter sense, that is, nominally, or conventionally. lt will be important to keep this ambiguity in "exists" in mind throughout the text, particularly in order to see the subtle interplay between the two truths and the way in which the doctrine of the emptiness of empti- ness resolves apparent paradoxes in the account.
And this analysis in terms of emptiness-an analysis refusing to characterize the nature of anything precisely because it denies that we can make sense of the idea of a thing's nature-proceeding by
6. Note that nothing in this example hinges on the fact that the table is an artifact. The same points could be made about the tree from which its wood was hewn. The boundaries of the tree, both spatial and temporal (consider the junctures between root and       or      and air; between live and dead wood; between seed, shoot, and tree); its identity over time (cach year it sheds its        and grows new ones; some       break; new limbs grow); its existence as a unitary object, as opposed to a            of        etc., are all conventional. Removing its properties        no core bearer behind. Searching for the tree that is independent of and which is the bearer of its parts, we come up empty. I thank Graham Parkes for painting out the need to stress this point.
￼lntroduction to the Commentary 91
the relentless refutation of any attempt to provide such a positive analysis, is applied by Niigiirjuna to all phenomena, including, most radically, emptiness itself. For if Niigiirjuna merely argued that all phenomena are empty, one might justly indict him for merely replacing one analysis of things with another, that is, with arguing that emptiness is the essence of all things. But Niigiirjuna, as we shall see, argues that emptiness itself is empty. Jt is not a self- existent void standing behind a veil of          comprising conven- tional reality, but merely a               of conventional reality. And this, as we shall see, is what provides the key to understanding the deep unity between the two truths.7
While Niigiirjuna is a powerfully original thinker, he is clearly and self-consciously operating squarely within the framework of Buddhist philosophy. As such, Niigiirjuna accepts and takes it as incumbent upon him to provide an account of the Four Noble Truths, nirvar:ia, buddhahood, and other fundamental Buddhist               conceptions. Moreover, he takes it as a fundamen- tal philosophical task to provide an understanding of what Bud- dhist philosophy refers to as prall1yasamutpada-dependent co- origination. This term denotes the nexus between phenomena in virtue of which events depend on other events, composites de- pend on their parts, and so forth. Exactly how this dependency is spelled out, and exactly what its status is, is a matter of consider- able debate within Buddhist philosophy, just as the nature of causation and explanation is a matter of great dispute within Westem philosophy. Niigiirjuna is very much concerned to stake out a radical and revealing position in this debate. We will, in fact, see that this position and its connection to his understanding of emptiness and the nirviir:ia-saQ1siira relation provides the key to understanding his entire text.
Ma/amadhyamakak&lt;lrik&lt;l is divided into twenty-seven chapters, which fali roughly, though by no means officially, into four sec- tions. In the first section of the text,           Chapters I through VII, Niigiirjuna discusses the fundamental theoretical constructs in Buddhist ontology, such as dependent             change and im-
7. Siderits (1989) puts this point nicely: "The ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth" (p. 6).
￼92 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
permanence, perception, the aggregates that compose the self, the elements that constitute the universe, and the relation between substance and attribute. In the· second major section, Chapters VIII through XIII, Niigiirjuna focuses on the nature of the self and of subjective experience. Chapters XIV through XXI are primarily concerned with the external world and the relation of the self to objects. The       section, Chapters XXII through XXVII, ad- dresses phenomena associated with the ultimate truth, such as bud- dhahood, emptiness, and nirviii;ia, and the relation of the conven- tional to the ultimate and of sa!Jlsiira to nirviii;ia. The chapters that form the climax of the text are found in this section. But it is important to note that in fact the dialectical structure of the text requires a reading of these chapters in order to fully grasp the import of the earlier ones. This is because the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness does not fully emerge until this point, and it is crucial to Niigiirjuna's argument that all phenomena are empty and that their emptiness is also empty.8
The order. of the chapters is often, though not always, impor- tant. Often a chapter will consider a phenomenon held by a propo- nent of another philosophical school to be inherently existent. Or an opponent may charge Niigarjuna with denying the actuality of a phenomenon in virtue of asserting its emptiness. In his analysis, Niigiirjuna will typically argue that the phenomenon proposed as inherently existent cannot be so and indeed is empty, or that the phenomenon whose existence he is charged with denying is, in fact, on his analysis, while nonexistent from the ultimate pofot of view, conventionally existent. In each case, he will argue that the functions the opponent thought could only be served by an inher- ently existent phenomenon can, in fact, be served only by empty phenomena. But quite often these analyses will inspire natura! rejoinders of the form, "Yes, x might well be empty and only conventionally existent, but we can't make sense of its conven- tional existence without presupposing the inherent existence of y."
8. Ishouldnotethatthisdivisionofthetcxtisnotinanysensecanonical.Tsong Khapa sees the structure slightly differently; Kalupahana (1986) proposes yet an- other structure. I see my own division, like these others, simply as a        heuristic device for parsing the argument. (lt should be noted that the division of the text even into chapters is due to Candrakirti.)
￼lntroduction to the Commentary 93
In such cases, the next chapter will typically address thai natural rejoinder. So, for instance, the first chapter argues thai conditions and the relation between phenomena and that on which they de- pend are empty. But a natural rejoinder is that even conventional but actual conditions can only be understood in the context of change or impermanence. So Chapter II addresses change. The text hence forms a single sustained argument with only a few digres- sions or changes of subject, generally marked by the section divi- sions I have suggested above.
The first chapter addresses dependent origination. While many Westem commentators assert that this chapter opens the text sim- ply because it addresses a "fundamental doctrine of Buddhism,"9 my analysis of the text suggests that Niigiirjuna begins with causa- tion for deeper, more systematic reasons. In Chapters II through XXI, Niigiirjuna addresses a wide range of phenomena, including extemal perceptibles, psychological processes, relations, putative substances, and attributes, arguing thai all are empty. In the       six chapters, Niigiirjuna generalizes the particular analyses into a broad theory conceming the nature of emptiness itself and the nature of the ultimate, of liberation, and of the relation between emptiness and dependent arising. At the close, he replies to objec- tions. lt is generally, and in my view correctly, acknowledged that Chapter XXIV, the examination of the Four Noble Truths, is the central chapter of the text and the climax of the argument, with Chapter XXV on nirviii:ia and sa111siira sharing thai spotlight. One verse of Chapter XXIV, verse 18, has received so much attention that interpretations of it alone represent the foundations of major Buddhist schools in East Asia:
18. Whatever is dependently co-arisen That is explained to be emptiness.
Thai, being a dependent designation Is itself the middle way.
Here Niigiirjuna asserts the fundamental identity of (1) empti- ness, or the ultimate truth; (2) the dependently originated, that is,

￼94 THE TEXT ANO COMMENTARY
all phenomena; and (3) verba! convention. Moreover, he asserts that understanding this relation is itself the middle-way philosophi- cal view he articulates in MU/amadhyamakakarikii. This verse and the discussion in the chapters that follow provide the fulcrum for Candrakirti'smoreexplicitcharacterizationoftheemptinessofemp- tiness as an interpretation of Nagii.rjuna's philosophical system- the interpretation that is definitive of the Prii.sa!lgika-Mii.dhyamika school.10 In what follows I will provide an interpretation of the text inspired by the centrality of this verse and of the chapters forming its context that harmonizes with Candrakirti's. In fact, on my reading ofthe text this doctrine is already found in the opening chapter-the examination of conditions. Reading the text in this way locates the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness not only as a dramatic philo- sophical conclusion to be drawn at the end of twenty-four chapters of argument, but as the perspective implicit in the argument from the very beginning and only rendered explicit in XXIV. Reading the text in this way will show us exactly how XXIV:J8 is to be under- stood and just why a proper understanding of causality is so central to Buddhist philosophy.
When a Westerner first encounters Ma/amadhyamakakarikii or other Mii.dhyamika texts, the philosophical approach can appear highly metaphysical and downright weird. The unfamiliar philo- sophical vocabulary, the highly negative dialectic, and the cryptic verse form are indeed forbidding. Most bizarre of all, however, at first glance is the doctrine that all phenomena, including self and its objects, are empty. For indeed Nii.gii.rjuna and his followers do argue that the entire everyday world is, from the ultimate stand- point, nonexistent. And that does appear to stand just a bit deeper into philosophical left field than even Berkeley dares to play. But if the interpretation I will urge is adopted, the real central thrust of Mii.dhyamika is the demystification of this apparently mystica! con- clusion. White it might appear that the Mii.dhyamikas argue that nothing really exists except a formless void, in fact the actuality of

￼lntroduction to the Commentary 95
the entire phenomenal world, persons and all, is recovered within that emptiness.11
Now a word about the methodology and intent of this commen- tary: Since the intended audience is Western philosophers and students of philosophy whose primary study has been in the West- ern tradition, I have tried throughout, insofar as that is possible without distortion of the meaning of the !ext, to explain Niigiir- juna's arguments and positions in language familiar to Western philosophers. I have occasionally used analogies to positions and. arguments found in Western texts, but have avoided doing so where I thought that the comparisons might force a Procrustean analysis of Niigiirjuna's own views. And it is, of course, impossible and pointless to completely recast Niigiirjuna's positions as those with which we in the West are familiar and to replace his technical terminology with ours. For Niigiirjuna is not a Western philoso- pher. He is an Indian Buddhist philosopher whose work we ap- proach through a vast Asian Buddhist commentarial literature. And while many of his concerns, problems, theses, and arguments are recognizable cousins of ours, many are not, and there are genuine differences in outlook.
This is what makes Niigiirjuna's work so exciting to read and to think about-it provides a genuinely distinctive perspective on a set of problems and projects that we share. In commenting on Niigiirjuna's text, I am constantly aware of walking a philosophical and hermeneutical tightrope. On the one hand, one could provide a perfectly traditional commentary on the text-or better, a transla- tion of one of the major Sanskrit or Tibetan commentaries-or a transcript of      commentary by a recognized scholar of the tradi- tion. Such a commentary would explain in great detail the way the text is seen from the perspective of its home tradition and the background of Buddhist controversies to which the text responds. A commentary like this would undoubtedly be of great use to Buddhologists and philosophers already steeped in Buddhist phi-
11. For useful discussions of the recovery of the conventional within emptiness and the relation between the two truths in Mlldhyamika philosophy, see Sprung (1973, 1979), esp. 1973, pp. 15-20; Newland (1992); Napper(l992); Streng (1967), _esp.       3.
￼96 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
losophy and its bistory. And indeed Sprung's translation of most of Candrakirti's Prasannapadii (Lucid Exposition), including the root verses from Mulamadhyamakakiirikii, partially fulfills this need. But many of these scholars and students already have access to the relevant texts in their original languages or to teachers situated within the Buddhist tradition.
On the other hand, one could try to comment on the text by presenting a theory of what Niigiirjuna would have said bad he been a twentieth-century Westem philosopher. One could then feel free to step back from the intemecine debates in the classical Buddhist academy, which were so absorbing to the historical Niigiirjuna and so distant from our owo context, and simply ask how his arguments would be formulated in the context of the contemporary philosophical scene. Leaving aside the question of how one would identify the possible philosopher denoted by this bizarre counterfactual, this would again be a profoundly unsatisfy- ing enterprise. For what makes this a great text is not simply that we can extrapolate its significance to our owo context, but that in reading it, to borrow Gadamer's metaphor, we are able to fuse its textual horizon with our own. It is the bringing to the present of Niigiirjuna's own concems, insights, and arguments that is revela- tory, not speculation about a related counterfactual nonentity. And for this fusion of interpretive horizons to be possible, we most, as much as possible, respect the original horizon of the text.
Having said this, one most confess the double difficulty of giving sense to the phrase "Niigiirjuna's own concems, insights, and argu- ments." The recovery of authorial intent as a hermeneutic task is problematic (especially when the author is so culturotemporally remote and when his corpus is as controversial in composition and interpretation as is Niigiirjuna's). But it is equally problematic as a hermeneutic desideratum. For who is to say that Niigiirjuna was/is the best possible interpreter of Mulamadhyamakakiirikii? After all, he did not have the benefit of the long commentarial tradition he spawned.12 A great text-or, as Gadamer has referred to such

texts, an "eminent text"....,-grows over time and merits reinterpreta-
tion and rereading as the tradition in which it participates develops and provides an ever-expanding context for its reading. Moreover, I am reading Nagarjuna largely through the lens of the Tibetan commentarial tradition and through the Tibetan translation of his          text read and discussed by the scholars of this long, deep, and intellectually diverse and rich tradition, few of whom had access to Sanskrit. So the Nagarjuna whose views I am explor- ing is an evolving figure, rooted in the life and writing of a first or second century Indian monk, of whom we know but little, but whose literary life and identity extends through a complex, sophisti- cated, and contested textual and philosophical tradition in India and Tibet and in the West.
As a conseGuence, in interpreting this text on the Middle Path for a Western audience, I have sought insofar as possible to !ind a middle path between these extremes. I have tried to explain Nagarjuna's owo arguments and their context as straightforwardly as possible without burdening the Western philosophical reader with extended discussion of the specifically ancient Indian Bud- dhist philosophical debates. I have indicated ways in which very specific arguments can be generalized and have commented on         structural features of arguments, chapters, and the text. I have throughout explained arguments in Western philosophical terms, while situating those arguments in their Buddhist context. There may be times when my desire to make arguments accessible has led to some distortion in Nagarjuna's sense. There may also be times at which, by leaving arguments set firmly within the soterio- logical context of Buddhism, I have left those arguments looking like curios to my Western audience. Some of this may be unavoid-
able, but in any case I have sought specifically to minimize these difficulties.
The interpretation I offer is situated squarely within a Prasailgika- Madhyamika interpretation of Nagarjuna (the philosophical school that reads Mit/amadhyamakakiirikii through the commentaries of Buddhapalita and Candrakirti). But more specifically, my reading is heavily influenced by the Tibetan          tradition that takes as central the commentaries of dGe-'dun-grub, mKhas-grub-rje, and especially, Je Tsong Khapa. My interpretation of the text reflects not
￼98 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
only Candrakirti's and Je Tsong Khapa's commentaries, but also the extended      commentary I have received on this text from the eminent Tibetan Miidhyamika scholars, especially the Ven. Profes- sor Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas of the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and the Ven. Professor Gen Lobzang Gyatso of the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics (I should point out thai both of these scholars-as well as others to whom I am indebted for val- uable conversations, including the Most Ven. Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche and the Ven. Geshe Namgyal Wangchen-received their education at Drepung Loseling Monastic College, and so my inter- pretation also reftects more particularly the academic tradition of that institution).
Having characterized this as a tradition of interpretation, I musi emphasize thai it is not, as it is often represented, and as it often represents itself, a homogeneous tradition. Though there is a hermeneutic convention in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature of pre- senting oneself as merely expounding faithfully the views of all of the earlier commentators, this is almost never the truth. There are considerable divergences in interpretation and in philosophical posi- tion within Buddhist schools and within lineages. Indeed the Ti- betan scholars I have regularly consulted, despite the fact thai they shared many of the same teachers and an identical curriculum, differ widely among themselves on many issues. li would hence be impossi- ble in any case to represent accurately the                         interpretation, or even the Geluk-pa interpretation or the Drepung Loseling interpretation of Mulamadhyamakakiirikii.
I emphasize thai even if one could identify such a homogeneous interpretation, I am not here presenting the interpretation or inter- pretations of any of these commentators or scholars, individually or collectively. There are substantial debates within these tradi- tions regarding interpretative issues, and I do not consistently side with any particular faction (though I do think thai it is true thai my reading never confticts directly with thai of Candrakirti); some- times (as in my reading of the       chapter) I depart from the most common Geluk-pa interpretation entirely in favor of a line more closely associated with the Nyingma-pa reading of the text. Nor is the purpose of this text to compare, criticize, and resolve differ- ences between interpretations. Instead, I here present the text as I
￼Introduction to the Commentary 99
read it, having been inftuenced by all of these commentators and teachers, and as I present it to my Western colleagues. And my intention in doing so is to let the text stand alone as a work of philosophy valuable in its own right to anyone interested in funda- mental metaphysical, epistemological, and soteriological ques- tions, not as a text to be studied only as part of "the history of philosophy" or "comparative philosophy."
Moreover, my exposition will be deliberately sympathetic. My goal is not to assess Nagarjuna's philosophy, but to present and elucidate it and to do so in a way thai, while making the text accessible to Western philosophers, does not disguise the fact thai the text made accessible is an early Indian Madhyamika philosophi- cal treatise, read by a Western philosopher through an extended lndo-Tibetan commentarial and academic tradition. li is neither a contemporary treatise nor a second century text transported mi- raculously to us without the distortion of time and cultural dis- tance. Buddhologists may lament the lack of critical discussion of
. Buddhist antecedents and commentarial sequellae, and my Ti- betan colleagues may be uncomfortable with some of the tenden- tious extensions of arguments beyond the dialectical contexts in which they originally arose. Despite this, I hope thai for Western philosophers interested in approaching Madhyamika in particular or Buddhist philosophy in          and for students of Nagarjuna's philosophy in the West, this exposition will make his text more accessible.
￼Dedicatory Verses
I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,
The best of teachers, who taught that Whatever is dependently arisen is Unceasing, unborn,
Unannihilated, not permanent,
Not coming, not going,
Without distinction, without identity, And free from conceptual construction.
Dedicatory verses are often treated as mere performatives. But these are special and announce in a subtle ·but powerful way the program of the Mulamadhyamakakiirikii. There is a common point being made in the four pairwise denials, but also a specific insight being expressed in each. The relation between the conventional and the ultimate that will be developed in the text is also expressed poetically in the dedication. In fact, Candrakirti, in Prasannapadii, argues that the dedication determines the Priisailgika reading of Niigiirjuna's text.
Candrakirti's point is this: In the four pairwise denials, Nagiir- juna is announcing that the Madhyamika philosopher will make no positive assertions about the fundamental nature of things. But this claim must be qualified in severa! ways. For one thing, we must take the phrase "the nature of things" very seriously. That is, Nagarjuna will be refusing to say anything about the essence of anything exactly because he will tleny the coherence and utility of the concept of an essence. For another, it is important to see that the predications that are rejected are intended to be understood as
￼Dedicatory Verses 101
made from the          standpoint. That is, the assertions that are being denied are assertions about the       nature of phenomena thai emerge from philosophical           They are not meant to be ordinary assertions dependent upon conventions. Niigiirjuna will deny that it is possible to assert anything from the          stand- point. He will urge that all truth is          and               In fact, as we shall see, these                turo out to be mutually           
But each pair is significant in its owo right. To say that "whatever is             arisen is unceasing and unbom" is to emphasize that dependent arising amounts to emptiness, and emptiness amounts to nonexistence in the ultimate sense. White, as we shall see, Niigiirjuna defends the              existence of phenomena, he will urge that none of them            exist-that none of them exist independently of convention with identities and natures that they possess in             Therefore, he will argue, nothing              is boro, and from the ultimate standpoint there is nothing to cease. This is a deep point, which      emerges            through a reading of the       text. But we can say at this point thai Ibis insight contains within it the seeds of the          equa- tion of the            world with emptiness, .of sa!Jlsiira with nirviii;ia, and of the              and the          thai are the hallmarks of the Priisai;igika-Miidhyamika view.
When Niigiirjuna        that "whatever is dependently arisen is ... unanihilated and not permanent" he indicates that the de- pendently arisen world and all of its contents are, in virtue of being             arisen and dependent upon conditions, impermanent. Phenomena come into existence when the conditions upon which they depend obtain, and they cease to exist when the conditions for their continued existence no        obtain. This impermanence, he will argue, entails their nonexistence from the ultimate standpoint. For there will be no principled way to assert criteria for identity for phenomena that distinguish them in any principled way from their conditions. Nor can we find any essence they themselves have that determines their identity. The criteria for identity we posil will end up being                      Hence the same is true for any        of             difference between things. But this imperma- nence and      of intrinsic identity, white it amounts to the impossi-
￼102 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
bility of ultimate existence, is not equivalent to annihilation. The empirical reality of things, on Niigarjuna's analysis, is not denied by asserting their emptiness.
Finally, to assert that things are "not coming, not going" is to assert thai the phenomenal world does not contain intrinsically identifiable entities that persist independently with those identities over time. As a consequence, there can be no sense in saying that any eolity, independent of conventional imputation, comes inio existence, remains in existence, or goes out of existence.13
The       remark-that the phenomenal world is free from con- ceptual imputation-raises a tension that is central to Miidhya- mika philosophy and thai animates the whole of the text: The tension between the desire to characterize the ultimate nature of things and the recognition thai all characterization is conventional. For Niigiirjuna will urge thai all conventional phenomena are con- ceptually designated, depending for whatever identity and exis- tence they have on such designation, and thai this merely imputed status is their ultimate nature. Despite this, however, he will urge that seeing this fact is at the same time to see that the nature naively imputed to things and the nature they appear to us to have-inherent existence-is wholly false. In themselves, from their side, things are free of that imputation, even though there is really nothing at all thai can be said from their side. This dynamie philosophical tension-a tension between the Miidhyamika ac- count of the limits of what can be coherently said and its analytical ostension of what can't be said without paradox but musi be understood-must constantly be borne in mind in reading the text. lt is not an incoherent mysticism, but it is a logical tightrope act at the very limits of language and metaphysics.
13. As Georges Dreyfus points out (personal communication), many Tibetan scholars read this line also as a comment on the selflessness of sentient beings-as indicating that there is no self that comes from previous lives and goes ón to future lives.
￼Chapter I Examination of Conditions
Central to this first chapter is the distinction between causes and conditions (Skt: hetu and pratyaya, Tib: rgyu and rkyen). This distinction is variously drawn and is controversial,14 and it is argu- ably differently understood in Sanskrit and Tibetan. The way I will understand it here, I argue, makes good, coherent sense not only of this chapter, but of Mulamadhyamakakiirikii as a whole. Briefly, we will understand this distinction as          When Nagarjuna uses the word "cause" (hetu, rgyu), he has in mind an event or state that has init a power (kriyii, bya-ba)15 to bring about its effect and has that power as part of its essence or nature (svabhiiva, rang bzhin). When he uses the term "condition" on the other hand
14. Some scholars With whom I have discussed this interpretation argue that there is no real difference between causes and conditions, some that a cause is one kind of condition, some that efficient causes are causes and all other causa! factors contributing to an event are conditions. Some like my reading. I have found no unanimity on this interpretive question, either among Westem Buddhologists or among Tibetan scholan. The canonical texts are equivocal as well. I do not argue that the distinction I here attribute to Niigiirjuna, which I defend 90 hermeneutical grounds, is necessarily drawn in the same way throughout the Buddhist philosophi- cal world or even throughout the Prasal'lgika-Madhyamika literature. But it is the · one Nagarjuna draws.
15. Some might quarrel with this translation, preferring to reserve "power" to translate "stob" (Skt: bd/a or shakti) and to translate "bya-ba" or "kriyd" as "activ- ity" or "action." But in this context "power," interpreted as causa) power, is just right.
￼104 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
(pratyaya, rkyen), he has in mind an event, state, or process that can be appealed to in explaining another event, state, or process wiihout any metaphysical commitment to any occult connection between explanandum and explanans. In Chapter I, Niigiirjuna, we shall see, argues against the existence of causes and for the existence of a variety of kinds of conditions. 1•
Things are not, however, quite this simple. For in the philosophi- cal context in which Niigiirjuna is writing, there are those-indeed including most Buddhist philosophical schools-who would accept his classification of conditions, but who would then assert that in order for conditions to function as explanatory, they must them- selves have an independent inherent existence. Some-such as the Sarvastivadas or Sautiintrika-Sviitantrikas (despite other differ- ences between these schools regarding causation)-would argue that the conditions must exist as substantially distinct from the conditioned; others, such as the Cittamiitra, would argue that they
16. There are two kinds of cases to be made for attributing this distinction to Nigirjuna in this chapter: Most generally, there is the hermeneutical argument that this makes the best phi,osophical sense of the text. lt gets Nigirjuna drawing a distinction that is clearly suggested by his philosophkal outlook and that lines up nice1y with the technical terms he deploys. But we can get more textually fine grained as well; in the first verse, Nigirjuna explicitly rejects the existence of efficacy and pointedly uses the word "cause." He denies that there are such things. Nowhere in Chapter I is there a parallel denial of the existence of oonditions. On the contrary, in I: 2 he positively asserts that there are four kinds of them. To be sure, this could be read as a mere partitioning of the class of effects that are described in Buddhist literature. But there are two reasons not to read it thus: First, Nagarjuna does not couch the assertion in one of his "il might be said'. locutions. Second. he never takes it back. The positive tone the text take:; regarding conditions is continued in I: 4-5, Where Nagarjuna asserts that conditions are conceived without efficacy in contrast with the causes rejected in Chapter I and where he endorses a regularist view of conditions. So il seems that Niigiirjuna does use the "cause„/"condition'· distinction to mark a distinction between the kind of association he endorses as an analysis of dependent arising and one he rejects. lnada (1970) among Western commentators agrees with this interpretation. Kalupahana (1986) seems to as well (see pp. 34-35). But see Streng (1973) and Wood (1994) for a contrasting interpretation, acoording to which Niigiirjuna is out to reject causes and conditions in the same sense, and accord- ing to which the distinction between the four conditions provides a platform for an exhaustive refutation of production with no positive account of interdependence implicated. This latter interpretation is adopted by Tsong Khapa (Sarnath ed., pp. 12ff.) and his followers as well. They attribute a like view to Candrakirti. But I would disagree at that point with their reading of Candrakirti's text.
￼Examination ofConditions 105
can be of the same nature.17 Nagarjuna will evade these particular debates, however, by emphasizing that the conditions he has in mind must be thought of as empty of inherent existence and con- nected to the phenomena they condition neither through absolute difference nor through identity. ·
The argument against causation is tightly intertwined with the positive account of dependent arising and of the nature of the relation between conditions and the conditioned. Nagarjuna be- gins by stating the conclusion (I: 1): Entities are neither self- caused nor do they come to be through the power of other entities. That is, there is no causation when causation is thought of as involving causal activity: 18
1. Neither from itself nor from another,
Nor from both,
Nor without a cause,
Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.
The fourfold classification of positions with regard to the rela- tion between an active cause and its effect is meant to be exhaus- tive. But it is important to keep in mind that Nagarjuna was aware of philosophical schools espousing each of these four positions. And each of them has something to say for itself if we begin by supposing a model of causation involving powers as essential prop- erties of               real causes. The first view-held promi- nently by Samkhya philosojlhers19-is that all causation is.        self-causation. A proponent of this view would argue that for a cause to be genuinely the cause of an effect, that effect must exist             in that cause. If it does not, then the cause might exist without the effect, in which case the cause would fail to necessitate the effect, in which case it would not be a genuine cause. This is

￼106 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
not to say that effects exist in full actuality in their causes, but that they have a genuine potentia( .existence when their causes exist. In this case, since the effect is present in the cause, it already has a kind of existence prior to its appearance. And it is the fact of this prior potentia( existence that accounts for the causa( character of the cause. So we can say, on this view, that a thing's prior potentia( existence is what gives rise to its later actual existence. So effects are in this sense self-caused. The typical kind of example appealed to in order to defend this model of causation is the seed and sprout relation. The sprout, although only actual after germination, is potentia( in the seed. lts potentiality is what makes the seed a seed of that sprout. Moreover, on this view, the seed and sprout cannot be distinguished as substantially different. Intuitively it makes sense to say that they are two stages of the same entity. But the seed is the cause of the sprout. Hence, the proponent of this view concludes, the sprout is self-caused.
Causation from another is a more familiar way of thinking of causation and was the dominant doctrine of causation in the Bud- dhist philosophical milieu in which Niigiirjuna was working. On this view, causes and their effects are genuinely distinct phenom- ena.20 They can be characterized and can in principle exist indepen- dently of one another. But they are related by the fact that one has the power to bring the other about. The relations between parents and children is an example often appealed to in              this doctrine. Parents bring their children into existence. But they are not identical entities.
The doctrine of causation by both self and other emerges through a juxtaposition of the doctrine of causation-from-another and the doctrine of self-causation. Let us return to the example of the seed. A proponent of other-causation might point out that seeds that are not planted, watered, and so forth, do not sprout. If the sprout were present in the seed, these other conditions, which are manifestly other than the sprout, would be otiose. On the

Some- times not. Where more precision is called for, I will be more specific, unless the context makes it elear which category is relevant.
￼Examination ofConditions 107
other hand, the proponent of self-causation might reply: No matter how much you water, nourish, and exhort an infertile seed-one without the potentially existent sprout-nothing happens. So all of the distinct conditions in the world will not suffice absent the poten- tia! existence of the effect. The happy compromise doctrine that emerges is the doctrine of causation-by-both: Effects are the result of the joint operation of the effect itself in potentio and the exter- nal conditions necessary to raise the effect's mode of existence from potentiality to actuality.
The fourth alternative view of causation is that things simply spontaneously arise from no particular causes-that there are no links at all between events. What might motivate sucha view? Weil, as we shall see (and asany reader of Sextus Empiricus, Hume, or Wittgenstein will recall), there are powerful reasons for believing that none of the three alternatives just rehearsed can be made coher- ent. And if one believed that only if there were either some identity or difference between causes and effects could there be a relation of dependency between phenomena, one would be forced to the nihilis- tic conclusion that things simply arise causelessly.
Nonetheless, Niigiirjuna notes, there are col)ditions-in fact four distinct kinds-that can be appealed to in the explanation and prediction of phenomena:
2. There are four conditions: efficient condition;                condition; immediate condition;
·Dominant condition, just so. There is no fifth condition.
The         classification of conditions Niigiirjuna employs is pretty standard in Indian and especially in Buddhist accounts of explanation. But there are two specific features of Niigarjuna's pre- sentation that should be noted: First, since he is writing with specifi- cally soteriological goals in mind, which require the practicioner to develop a deep insight into the nature of his/her owo mind, there is a specifically psychological emphasis in the presentation. We must be aware both of this emphasis and of the natura! generalization away from that particular domain that the account supports. Second, it will be of paramount importance to Niigiirjuna that the analysis of
￼108 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
the relation of conditions to the conditioned involves ascribing nei- ther inherent existence nor causal power to the conditions.
Efficient conditions are those salient events that explain the occurrence of subsequent events: Striking a match is the efficient condition for its lighting. My fingers depressing the keys of this computer is the efficient condition for the creation of this text.
The percept-object condition is in its primary sense the object in the environment thai is the condition for a mind's perception of it. So when you see a tree, the physical tree in the environment is the percept-object condition of your perceptual state. Now things get vexed here in a number of ways. First, there is no unanimity in the world, or even in Buddhist philosophy, regarding the analysis of perception and, hence, no consensus on the view just adumbrated- that external objects are the percept-object conditions of perceptual awareness. Idealists, for instance, argue thai the percept-object conditions are to be located in the subject. Second, many fans of percept-object conditions, on both sides of the idealist/realist di- vide, argue thai the substantial existence of such a condition, and the appropriate exercise of its power to produce perception, is a necessary condition of perception. Niigiirjuna will be concerned to reject any such analysis-whether idealist or realist-in virtue of his attack on the notions of substantial existence, substantial differ- ence, and causal power. Third, within the psychological domain, the account generalizes beyond perception. Conceptual states, imagin- ings, reasoning-all can have percept-object conditions. To West- ern philosophical ears this seems odd. But from the standpoint of Buddhist epistemology and psychology, intentional21 activity gener- ally is the natural kind comprised by "perception." So the point is thai the intentional existence of the golden mountain ;s a percept- object condition of my being able to doubt thai there is such· a thing. Finally, the analysis bears generalization well beyond the psychologi- cal. For at the most abstract level, what is distinct about a percept- object condition is its existence simultaneously with and as a support for what it conditions. So Nagarjuna's attack on a substantialist
21. "lntentional" is here being used in the sense of Brentano and of recent Western philosophy of mind-to mean contentful or directed upon an object. I do not use the term to mean purposeful.
￼Examination ofConditions 109
understanding of this kind of explanans will apply, mutatis mutan- dis, to the case of a table supporting a book.
The dominant condition is the purpose or end for which an action is undertaken. My hoped for understanding of Miidhyamika might be the dominant condition for my reading Niigiirjuna's text, its presence before my eyes the percept-object condition, and the           light striking my eyes the efficient condition. The immedi- ate conditions are the countless intermediary phenomena thai emerge upon the analysis of a causal chain, in this case, the pho- tons striking my retina, the excitation of photoreceptor cells, and SO forth.22
A nonpsychological example might be useful to illustrate the difference between the four kinds of condition and the picture Niigiirjuna suggests of explanation in the most         sense: Sup- pose thai you ask, "Why are the lights on?" I might reply as follows: (1) "Because I         the switch." I have appealed to an efficient condition. Or, (2) "Because the wires are in good working order, the bulbs haven't burned out, and the electricity is           These are supporting conditions. Or, (3) "'The light is the emission of photons each of which is emitted in response to the bombard- ment of an atom by an electron, and so forth." I have appealed to a chain of immediate conditions. Or, (4) "So that we can see." This is the dominant condition. Any of these would be a perfectly good answer to the "Why?" question. But note thai none of them makes reference to any causal powers or necessitation."
22. GeorgesDreyfus(personalcommunication)notesthattheunderstandingof the nature of percept-object conditions and dominant conditions in Mahayana Buddhist philosophy undergoes a significant transformation a few centuries later at the hands of Dignaga and Dharmakirti and that Nagarjuna is here making use of older Sarvastiviidan understandings of these terms to demonstrate the emptiness of conditions so understood.
23. Wood (1994) argues (see esp. pp. 48-53, pp. 63-64) that Nagarjuna here
argues that nothing arises at all. He claims that the argument begins by providing an exhaustive enumeration of the ways in which a thing could arise and then proceeds to eliminate each of these. This analysis, however, is problematic on two counts: First, it ignores the distinction between conventional, dependently arisen phenom- ena and inherently existent phenomena. To say that inherently existent phenomena cannot arise in any way, or that there can be no inherently existent production, is     thereby to say that there is no conventional dependency, or that there are no dependently arisen phenomena. Second, Wood ignores the positive account of
￼110 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The next three verses are crucial to Nagarjuna's understanding of the nature of conditions and their role in explanation. Nagar- juna first notes (I: 3) that in examining a phenomenon and its relations to its conditions, we don't find that phenomenon some- how contained potentially in those conditions:
3. The essence of entities
Is not present in the conditions, etc. . . . If there is no essence,
There can be no                   
The point being made in the first two lines of the verse is fairly straightforward. When we examine the set of conditions that give rise to an entity-for example, the set of conditions we detailed above for the shining of a lamp, or the conditions for seeing a tree we discussed previously-no analysis of those conditions yields the consequent effect. Dissecting light switches, wires, brains, and so forth, does not reveal any hidden light. Nor is there a tree percep- tion to be found already in the existence of the tree, the eye, and so forth. Rather these phenomena arise as consequences of the collocation of those conditions. To borrow a Kantian tum of phrase, phenomena are not analytically contained in their condi-
dependence on conditions presented in this chapter. His interpretations of the various commentaries that he cites in defense of this nihilistic reading arc similarly marked by inattention to this set of distinctions, which I (and many others, includ- ing both canonical and modern interpreters) argue are crucial to understanding this text. Wood says, "lf Nigirjuna wished to avoid the nihilistic conclusion that things do not originate period, he would never have said in 1.la that things do not arise. Furthermore, he would        have had to specify the way that things do arise, but in some miraculous or inexplicable way" (p. 63 {emphasis in original]). But on my reading at I: 1, Nigirjuna does not say that things do not arise period. He simply says that they do not arise by means of an inherently existent causal process. And he does both here and in subsequent chapters explain how things arise in a decid-      noruniraculous way.
But see Nagao (1989) for an interpretation in accord with my own:
"Dependent co-arising refers to a causal relationship wherein no essence is pres- entat any time in either cause or result. Thus the sentence 'Nothing arises from itself; nothing arises from another,' is not intended to refute arising. It is a negation of others that might be explained as 'from themselves' or 'from oth- ers.' " (p. 7)
￼Examination ofConditions 111
tions; rather, a synthesis is required out of which a phenomenon not an.tecedently existent comes to be.
But Niigiirjuna, through his use of the phrase "the essence of entities" (dngos-po rnams kyi rang bzhin), emphasizes a very im- portant metaphysical consequence of this observation: Given that phenomena depend upon their conditions for their existence and given that nothing answering to an essence of phenomena can be located in those conditions and given that there is nowhere else that an essence could come from, it follows that phenomena that arise from conditions are essenceless. One might argue at this point that just as phenomena come into existence dependent upon conditions, their essences come into existence in this way. But what goes for phenomena24 does not go for essences. For essences are by definition eternal and fixed. They are independent. And for a phenomenon to have an essence is for it to have some permanent independent core. So neither essences nor phenomena with es- sences can emerge from conditions.
The next two lines require a careful gloss, both because of the complexity of the philosophical point at stake and because of the Buddhist philosophical term of art I translate as "otherness- essence" (Skt: parabhiiva, Tib: gzhan dngos). Let us begin by gloss- ing that term. In its primary sense il means to have, as a thing's nature, dependence upon another for existence. So for a table, for instance, to have othemess-essence, according to a proponent of this analysis of the nature of things, might be for it to have as an essential characteristic the property of depending for its existence on some pieces of wood, a carpenter, and so forth. This way of thinking of the nature of things has great appeal-was used by those who defended the analysis of causation as production from other and the analysis of causes and their effects according to which they are linked by causal powers inhering in the causes-particularly for other Buddhist schools who would want to join with Niigiirjuna in denying essence to phenomena. For such a philosopher, it would be congenial to argue that the table has no essence of its own, but has the essential property of depending on its parts, causes, and so
24.            given the analysis Nagarjuna will develop of phenomena as empty. See especially chapters XV, XVIII, XXIV.

\
forth-an essential property that depends critically on another. And it would then be important to note thai this nature relies on the other having an intrinsic connection to the phenomenon in ques- tion, a connection realized in the causal powers (or other inherently existent relation to the effect) of thai other and, hence, in the other's own nature. Moreover, it is crucial to such an analysis, if it is not to lapse inio the absurdities thai plague self-causation, thai there be a real, substantial difference in entity-a difference in intrinsicnature between the dependent phenomenon and the conditions on which it depends. Absent such a difference, the otherness required in the analysis cannot be established.25
Given this understanding of otherness-essence, we can see the arguments Nagarjuna is ostending in the last two lines of this verse. First, since all entities are without their own essences (thai is, without essences thai can be specified intrinsically without refer- ence to anything else), the other with respect to which any phe- nomenon is purportedly essentially characterized will be without an essence, and so there will be no basis on which to build this otherness-essence. Second, without individual essences, there will be no basis on which to draw the absolute, essential distinctions necessary to establish phenomena as intrinsically other than their conditions. Without individual essences there are not substantial differences. Without substantial differences, there areno absolute others by means of which to characterize phenomena. Third, in order to characterize phenomena as essentially different from their conditions, it is important to be able to characterize them indepen- dently. Otherwise, each depends for its identity on the other, and they are not       distinct in nature. But the whole point of otherness-essence is thai things in virtue of having it are essentially dependent. So the view is in fact internally contradictory. Given thai things have no intrinsic nature, they are not essentially differ- ent. Given thai lack of difference, they are interdependent. But given that interdependence, there cannot be the otherness needed to build otherness-essence out of dependence.
Now, on the reading of this chapter thai I am suggesting, we can see conditions simply as useful explanans. Using this language,
25. Streng (1967) makes a similar point. See pp. 44-45.
￼Examination ofConditions 113
Nagarjuna is urging that even distinguishing between explanans and explanandum as distinct entities, with the former containing potentially what the latter has actually, is problematic. What we are typically confronted with in nature is a vast network of interde- pendent and continuous processes, and carving out particular phe- nomena for explanation or for use in explanations depends more on our explanatory interests and language than on joints nature presents to us. Through addressing the question of the potential existence of an event in its conditions, Niigiirjuna hints at this concealed relation between praxis and reality.
Next, Nagarjuna notes (I: 4) that in invoking an event or entity as a condition in explanation. we do not thereby ascribe it any causal power:
4. Power to act does not have conditions.
There is no power to act without conditions. There are no conditions without power to act. Nor do any have the power to act.
This is the beginning of Nagarjuna's attack on the causal power/ cement-of-the-universe view of causation and his contrastive devel- opment of his regularity view of conditioned dependent arising. Causal powers, according to those who posil them, are meant to explain the causal nexus-they are meant to explain how it is that causes bring about their effects, which is itself supposed to be otherwise inexplicable. But, Nagarjuna argues, if there were a causal power, it itself, as a phenomenon, would either have to have conditions or not. If the former, there is a vicious explanatory regress, for then one has to explain how the powers to act are themselves brought about by the conditions, and this is the very link presupposed by the friend of powers to be inexplicable. One could posil powers the conditions have to bring about powers and powers the powers have to bring about effects. But this just moves one step further down the regress.
lf, on the other hand, one suggests that the powers have no condition, one is stuck positing uncaused and inexplicable occult entities as the explanans of causation. If what is to be explained is how it is that all phenomena are brought about by causal pro-
￼114 THE TEXT :A.ND COMMENTARY
cesses, it is a bit embarrassing to do so by reference to unobserved entities thai are explicitly exempted from this otherwise universal condition. Moreover, there is then no explanation of how these powers arise and why they come to be where they are. This is all startlingly anticipatory of Wittgenstein's famous echo of Hume in the Tractatus:
6.371 The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the
illusion that the           laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.
6.372 Tuus people today stop at the Iaws of nature, treating them as
something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages.
And in !act both are right and both are wrong: though the view of the
ancients is clearer in so far as they have a elear and acknowledged termi- nus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.26
In the next two lines, as we will often see in the text, Nagarjuna is speaking in two senses-first, from the conventional standpoint, and second, from the ultimate. In the third line of the verse, he notes thai conditions can certainly, in a perfectly legitimate sense, be appealed to as the things thai bring about their effects; in thai sense, we can say thai they are efficacious-that they have the power to act. But in the fourth line he emphasizes thai we cannot, so to speak, quantify over this power, identifying it as a phenome- non or property possessed by the conditions. There are no powers in thai sense. Just as we can act for someone else's sake, despite there being no sakes, we can appeal to the potency of conditions despite their being no such potency. The trick is to make correct
26. There is, as Tuck (1990) has noted, a current fashion of using Wittgenstein to explicate Nliglirjuna and other Midhyamika philosophers. Most (e.g. Hunting- ton [1983a, 1983b, 1989], Gudmunson [1977], and Thurman [1984]) emphasize connections to the Philosophical lnvestigations, indeed with good reason. But (as Waldo [1975, 1978] and Anderson [1985] as well as Garfield [1990, 1994, unpub- lished] have noted) the Tractatus is also a useful fulcrum for exegesis, particularly of Nigirjuna's work. Tractarian ideas also inform my discussion of Nigirjuna on positionlessness, the limits of expressibility, and the relation between the two truths below, None of this, however, should be taken either as implying that Nigirjuna would agree with everything in the Traclatus (assuredly he would not) or that the parallels drawn betweCn Midhyamika philosophy and themes in the Philosophical lnvestigations arc spurious. They arc in fact often quite illuminating.
￼Examination ofConditions 115
use of conventional locutions without reifying denotata for all of the terms. For example, we might ask a farmer, "Do these seeds have the power to sprout?" as a way of asking whether they are fertile. It would be then perfectly appropriate for bim to answer in the affirmative. But if we then asked bim to show us where in the seed the power is located, he would be quite justified in regarding us as mad.27
Our desire for light does not exert some occult force on the lights. Nor is there anything to be found in the fticking of the switch other than the plastic, metal, movement, and connections visihle to the naked eye. Occult causa! powers are singularly ah- sent. On the other hand, Niigiirjuna points out in this discussion that this does not mean that conditions are explanatorily impotent. In a perfectly ordinary sense-not the sense that the metaphysi- cians of causation have in mind-our desire is active in the produc- tion of light. But not in the sense that it contains light potentially, or some special causa! power that connects our minds to the hulhs.
What is it, then, about some sets of event pairs (hut not others) that make them dependently related if not some causa! link ·present in those cases but not in others?
5. These give rise to those,
So these are called28 conditions.
As long as those do not come from these, Why are these not nonconditions?
One might answer this question, Niigiirjuna notes in the oppo- nent's suggestion in the first two lines, hy noting the presence of some relation of "giving rise to," realized in a power. But, he rejoins in the       two lines, this move is hlocked: For having shown the absence and the theoretical impotence of such a link, it · would follow that there would be no conditions. Niigiirjuna hence suggests here that it is the regularities that count. Flickings give

rise to illuminations. So they are conditions of them. If they didn't, they wouldn't be. Period. Explanation relies on regularities. Regu- larities are explained by reference to further regularities. Adding active forces or potentials adds nothing of explanatory utility to the picture.29
In reading the next few verses, we must be hermeneutically cautious .and pay careful attention to Niigiirjuna's use of the term "existent" (Tib: yod-pa, Skt: sat) and its negative contrastive "non- existent" (Tib: med-pa, asat). For Niigiirjuna is worried here about inherent existence and inherent nonexistence, as opposed to con- ventional existence or nonexistence. For a thing to exist inherently is for it to exist in virtue of possessing an essence-for it to exist independently of other entities and independently of convention. For a thing to be inherently nonexistent is for it to not exist in any sense at all-not even conventionally or dependenily. With this in mind, we can see how Niigiirjuna defends dependent arising while rejecting causation:
6. For neither an existent nor a nonexistent thing Is a condition appropriate.
lf a thing is nonexistent. how could it have a condition?
If a thing is already existent, what would a condition do?
He notes here thai if entities are conceived as inherently exis- tent, they exist independently and, hence, need no conditions for their production. Indeed, they could not be produced if they exist in this way. On the other hand, if things exist in no way whatso- ever, it follows trivially that they have no conditions.30 The follow-

To ask why there arc regularities at all, on sucha view, would be to ask an incoherent question: The fact o f explanatorily useful regularities in nature is what makes explanation and investigation possible in the first place and is not something itself that can be explained. After all, there is only one universe, and truly singular phenomena, on sucha view, are inexplicable in principle. This may connect deeply to the Buddha's insistence that questions concerning the beginning of the world are unanswerable.

￼Examination of Conditions 117 ing three verses make this point with regard to each of the four
kinds of conditions:
7. When neither existents nor
Nonexistents nor existent nonexistents are established, How could one propose a "productive cause?"
If there were one, it would be pointless.
8. An existent entity (mental episode)31 Has no object.
Since a mental episode is Without an object,
How could there be any percept-condition?
9. Since things are not arisen, Cessation is not acceptable.
Therefore, an immediate condition is not reasonable.
I f something has ceased, how could it be a condition?
In I: 7, Niigiirjuna is reasoning that since an inherently existent phenomenon is by definition independent, it could not have been produced by anything       An inherently nonexistent phenome- non certainly cannot be produced; if it were, it would be existent. An existent nonexistent (for instance, something posited by a Meinongian ontology-existing in a logical space, though not in the actual world) cannot be produced since its actual production would contradict its nonexistence and its production in some other way would contradict the inherent existence of the other sort pos- ited for it.
The argument in I: 8 is a bit different and is directed more              at the special status of simultaneous supporting condi- tions, such as those posited in perception, as discussed above. Niigiirjuna is making the following point: Jf we consider a particu-     moment of perception, the object of that perceptual episode no longer exists. This is so simply because of the mundane fact that the chain of events responsible for the arising of perceptual consciousness takes time. So the tree of whieh I am

aware now is a tree thai existed about one hundred milliseconds ago; not one thai exists now. The light took some time to reach my eye; the nerve impulses from the eye to the brain look some time; visual processing took stili more time. So if the story about how the tree is the percept-object condition of my perception according to which the tree exists simultaneously with the percep- tion and exerts a causa! power on my eye or visual consciousness were accepted, perception would be impossible. Moreover, the objects of many mental episodes are themselves nonexistent (like the golden mountain). But non-existents can't be causally respon- sible for anything.
Verse 9 contains two arguments. In the first half of the verse, Nagiirjuna is offering a quick reductio on the idea thai immediately preceding conditions can exist inherently. By definition, an immedi- ately preceding condition is a momentary element of a causa! chain. And, by definition, something that is inherently existent is independent; hence, it cannot arise depending on something else and, therefore, cannot cease to exist. But immediately preceding conditions must arise and cease. In the       line of the verse, Nagarjuna develops a related problem. Immediately preceding con- ditions must cease before their effect arises. If their existence and exertion of causa! power is what explains the arising of the cause, the arising of the cause is then inexpiicable. (This argument is also used by Sextus Empiricus in Against the Logicians.)
What is important about this strand of the argument? Niigiirjuna is drawing attention to the connection between a causa! power view of causation and an essentialist view of phenomena on the one hand, and between a condition view of dependent arising and a conventional view of phenomena on the other. If one views phenomena as having and as emerging from casual powers, one views them as having essences and as being connected to the es- sences of other phenomena. This, Niigarjuna suggests, is ulti- mately incoherent since it forces one at the same time to assert the inherent existence of these things, in virtue of their essential iden- tity, and to assert their dependence and productive character, in virtue of their causa! bistory and power. But such dependence and relational character, he suggests, is incompatible with their inher- ent existence. If, on the other hand, one regards things as depen-
￼Examination ofConditions 119
dent merely on conditions, one regards them as without essence and without power. And to regard something as without essence and without power is to regard it as merely conventionally exis- tent. And this is to regard it as existing dependently. This provides a coherent mundane understanding of phenomena as an alterna- tive to the metaphysics of reification thai Nagarjuna criticizes.
Verse 10 is central in this discussion:
10. I! things did not exist Without essence,
The phrase, "When this exists so this will be,"
Would not be acceptable.
Nagarjuna is replying here to the causa! realist's inference from the reality of causa! powers to their embodiment in real entities whose essences include those powers. He turns the tables on the realist, arguing that it is precisely because there is no such reality to things-and hence no entities to serve as the bearers of the causa! powers the realist wants to posit-that the Buddhist formula ex- pressing the truth of dependent arising'' can be asserted. lt could not be asserted if in fact there were real entities. For if they were real in the sense important for the realist, they would be indepen- dent. So if, the formula were interpreted in this context as pointing to any causa! power, it would be false. lt can only be interpreted, it would follow, as a formula expressing the regularity of nature.33

Readings like this are to be found in Inada (1970), Streng (1967), Sprung (1979), and Kalupahana (1986). They may be suggested by Candrakirti's comments to the effect that this phrase would make no sense were it asserted by the realist. But such a translation is not supported by the dialectical structure of the chapter and fon:es an excessively negative interpretation on the chapter as a whole. Moreover, as we shall see in Chapter XXIV, this would entail an untenable absolut· ism with respect to the ultimate truth and a corresponding untenable nihilism with respect to the conventional world. But see Nagao (1989) for a better reading:
The meaning of the traditional expressions "dependent upon this," or "if this exists then that         is not that when one essence exists, then some other essence exists apart from it. On the contrary, it is because both this and that do not exist as essences that, when this exists, then that also exists. (p. 7)
￼120 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
In the next three verses (I: 11-13), Niigiirjuna anticipates and
answers the causal realist's reply:
11. In the several or united conditions The effect cannot be found.
How could something not in the conditions Come from the conditions?
Here the realist argues that the conclusion Niigiirjuna draws from the unreality of causal power-the nonexistence of things (where "existence" is read "inherent existence")-entails the falsity of the claim that things dependently arise. For if there are no things, surely nothing arises. This charge has a double edge: If the argu- ment is successful it not only shows that Niigiirjuna's own position is vacuous, but that it contradicts one of the most fundamental tenets of Buddhist philosophy-that all phenomena are depen- dently arisen. Moreover, the opponent charges, on Niigiirjuna's view that the explanandum is not to be found potentially in the explanans, there is no explanation of how the former is to be understood as depending upon the latter. As Niigiirjuna will em- phasize in I: 14, however, the very structure of this charge contains the seeds of its reply. The very emptiness of the effect, an effect presupposed by the opponent to be nonempty, in fact follows from the emptiness of the conditiÓns and of the relationship between conditions and effect. Niigiirjuna will, hence, reply to the oppo- nent's attempted refutation by embracing the conclusion of his reductio together with the premises it supposedly refutes.
12. However, if a nonexistent effect Arises from these conditions,
Why      it not arise From nonconditions?
How, the opponent asks, are we to distinguish coincidental se- quence from causal consequence, or even from conventional de- pendence? And why don't things simply arise randomly from events that are nonconditions since no special connection is pos- ited to link consequents to their proper causal antecedents?
￼Examination of Conditions 121
13. lf the effect's essenc_e is the conditions,
But the conditions       have their own essence, How could an effect whose essence is the conditions Come from something that is essenceless?
Finally, the opponent asks, since the phenomena we observe clearly have natures, and since those natures clearly derive from their causes, how could it be, as Niigarjuna argues, that they pro- ceed by means of a process with no essence, from conditions with no essence? Whence do the natures of actual existents arise? Nagarjuna again will reply to this last charge by pointing out that since on his view the effects indeed have no essence, the oppo- nent's presupposition is ill-founded. This move also indicates a reply to the problem posed in I: 12. That problem is grounded in the mistaken view that a phenomenon's lack of inherent existence entails that it, being nonexistent, could come into existence from nowhere. But "from nowhere," for the opponent, means from something lacking inherent existence. And indeed, for Nagiirjuna, this is exactly the case: Effects lacking inherent existence depend precisely upon conditions that themselves lack inherent existence.
Niigiirjuna's summary of the import of this set of replies is terse and cryptic. But unpacking it with the aid of what has gone before provides an important key to understanding the doctrine of the emptiness of causation that is the burden of this chapter:
14. Therefore, neither with conditions as their essence,
Nor with nonconditions as their essence are there any effects. lf there are no such effects,
How could conditions or nonconditions be evident?
First, Nagiirjuna points out, the opponent begs the question in asserting the genuine existence of the effects in question. They, like their conditions, and like the process of dependent origination itself, are nonexistent from the ultimate point of view. That is, they have no essence whatever. Hence, the third charge fails. As a consequence, in the sense in which the opponent supposes that these effects proceed from their conditions-namely that their es- sence is contained potentially in their causes, which themselves
￼122 THE TEX'[ 'AND COMMENTARY
exist inherently-these effects need not be so produced. And so. finally, the effect-containing conditions for which the opponent charges Niigiirjuna with being unable to account are themselves unnecessary. In short, while the reificationist critic charges the Miidhyamika with failing to come up with a causal link sufficiently robust to link ultimately real phenomena, for the Miidhyamika philosopher the core reason for the absence of such a causal link is the very absence of such phenomena in the first place.
We are now in a position to characterize explicitly the emptiness of causation and the way this doctrine is identical with the doctrine of dependent origination from conditions adumbrated in this chap- ter. lt is best to offer this characterization using the via media formu- lation most consonant with Niigiirjuna's philosophical school. We will locate the doctrine as a midpoint between two extreme philo- sophical views. That midpoint is achieved by taking conventions as the foundation of ontology, hence rejecting the very enterprise of a philosophical search for the ontological foundations of convention (Garfield 1990). To say that causation is nonempty, or inherently existent, is to succumb to the temptation to ground our explanatory practice and discourse in genuine causal powers linking causes to effects. That is the reificationist extreme that Niigiirjuna clearly rejects. To respond to the arguments against the inherent existence of causation by suggesting that there is then no possibility of appeal- ing to conditions to explain phenomena-that there is no dependent origination at all-is the extreme of nihilism, also clearly rejected by Niigiirjuna. To assert the emptiness of causation is to accept the utility of our causal discourse and explanafory practice, but to resist the temptation to see these as grounded in reference to causal pow- ers or as demanding such grounding. Dependent origination simply is the explicability and coherence of the universe. lts emptiness is the fact that there is no more to it than that.
Keep this analysis in mind, for when we reach Chapter XXIV, in which the most explicit analysis of emptiness itself and of the rela- tion c;&gt;f emptiness to the conventional world is articulated, we will see that the principal philosophical move in Niigiirjuna's demysti- fication of emptiness was this attack on a reified view of causality. Niigiirjuna replaces the view shared by the metaphysician and the person in the street, a view that presents itself as common sense,
￼Examination o f Conditions 123
but is in fact deeply metaphysical, with an apparently paradoxical, thoroughly empty, but in the end commonsense view not only of causation, but of the entire phenomenal world. This theme-the replacement of apparent common sense that is deeply metaphysi- cally committed with an apparently deeply metaphysical but actu- ally commonsense understanding of the phenomenal world-will recur in each chapter of the text.
￼Chapter II Examination of Motion
The target of Niigiirjuna's arguments in this chapter is any view of motion according to which motion is an entity, or a property with an existence independent of that of moving things, or according to which motion is part of the nature of moving things. These are versions of what it would be to think of motion as nonempty. lt might be quite natural for a reificationist to reply to the argu- ments in Chapter I by proposing that such a view most be the case. For in Chapter I Nagiirjuna does presuppose, in developing the view that                things do arise ·dependent upon con- ditions, that there is motion, or change. For if there were not, there would be no arising. And as we have seen, !his would indeed be an absurd consequence for Niigarjuna. So, one might think, even if the links between conditions and their conse- quences are empty, the change represented by the arising of these consequences must be real.
Nagiirjuna argues that from such a view a number of absurd consequences would         Things not now in motion, but which were in motion in the past or which will be in the future, would have to undergo substantial change, effectively becoming different things when they change state from motion to rest or vice versa; a regress would ensue from the need for the entity motion itself to be in motion; motion would occur in the absence of moving things; the moment at which a thing begins or ceases motion would be
￼Examination of Motion 125 indescribable. Niigiirjuna concludes that a reification of motion is
incoherent. Motion is therefore empty.
1. What has been moved is not moving.
What has not been moved is not moving.
Apart from what has been moved and what has not been
moved,
Movement cannot be conceived.
That is, if motion exists, there must be sometime at which it exists. Niigiirjuna in this opening verse considers the past and the future. This makes good sense. For motion requires a change of position, and a change of position must occur over time. But the present has no duration. So if motion were to exist, it would have to exist either in the past or in the future. But a thing that has moved only in the past' is not now moving. Nor is a thing yet to be moved. One might, of course, suggest that there is a simple tense fallacy here-that things that were moving in the past were then in motion, thai things thai will move in the future will then be in motion. But this would be problematic. For that would mean that all motion would be in the past or in the future, and this could be said at any time. So there would be no time at which it would be true of any thing that it is in motion.34 But this intuition is behind the opponent's reply in the next verse:
2. Where there is change, there is motion. Since there is change in the moving, And not in the moved or not-moved, Motion is in that which is moving.
This verse is important not only because it announces the obvl- ous reply that motion exists in presently moving things, but be- cause it introduces the connection between change in         and motion. Though this interpretative point is controversial, and sev- eral scholars have given widely different interpretations," it is
34. The parallels to Zeno's paradoxes of motion, particularly that of the arrow, should be evident.

￼126 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
highly plausible that Nagarjuna is calling attention to the fact that the attack on motion as an inherently existent phenomenon is a         attack on seeing change or impermanence as inherently existent. This suggests that even the properties that according to Buddhist philosophy characterize all things-being dependently arisen and being impermanent-are not themselves inherently exis- tent. Nagarjuna replies:
3. How would it be acceptable For motion to be in the mover?
When it is not moving, it is not acceptable To call it a mover.
The point here is that if motion is thought of both as inherently existent and as a property of the mover, then it should, as inherently existent, continue to exist. For something that is inherently existent depends for nothing on its existence, and so it cannot be         of the conditions of its manifestation. That is because inherent exis- tence is existence with an essence, as an independent entity whose identity can be intrinsically specified. (See Chapter XV for more detail.) But movers come to rest. It would seem then that it would have to be            to call something a mover, even when it is at rest, since inherently existing motion could not cease.
4. For whomever there is motion in the mover, There could be nonmotion
Evident in the mover.
But having motion follows from being a mover.
on the other hand, argues that though the arguments could indeed be applied to change in          the chapter is specifically about motion through space. The Ven. Lobzang Norbu Shastri argues that it is in fact specifically only about walk- ing, and that any further generalization is illicit (all personal communication). I side with the Ven. Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas on this point since Nagarjuna offers                  arguments against change in properties. And it would seem especially elegant for Nagarjuna, who is attacking the tendency to reify, to begin with the two properties most subject to reification in Buddhist philosophy, in virtue of their universal applicability to phenomena and centrality to the Buddhist metaphysical framework-dependent arising and change. While the canonical commentaries I have consulted do not extend the argument in this direction, they do not preclude such an extension.
￼Examination of Morion 127
In this verse Niigarjuna begins his attack on the idea that motion is a property with an existence independent of movers. lf, he as- serts, one were to posit motion as such a property that simply happened to inhere in movers, it would follow from its indepen- dence that movers might not have it, but instead its contrary, namely, nonmotion. But that is not tenable. So it follows that motion can't be thought of as an independent property. This line of argument is continued in the next two verses:
5. If motion is in the mover,
There would have to be a twofold motion: One in virtue of which it 'is a mover,
And one in virtue of which it moves.
6. lf there were a twofold motion,
The subject of thai motion would be twofold.
For without a subject of motion, There cannot be motion.
Here Nagarjuna develops a reductio on a position according to which motion is a property of the mover only at the time that the mover is in motion. This might seem to be a much more plausible view than the earlier discussed view of motion as an essential prop- erty. But Niigarjuna argues that this can't work either. For it in- volves a multiplication of movements and agents of motion thai is unacceptable to the proponent of such a theory. For if the motion is a property of the mover at all, both the mover and the motion must be moving. And this amounts to two separate motions. One motion-that in virtue of which the mover is a mover in the first place-is the motion posited by the theory. But if that motion were stationary, the mover would either also not be moving or it would "outrun" its motion and leave it behind. So there must also be a mo- tion of the motion. Each of these two motions requires a subject. They can't be the same subject because then the mover and themo- tion would be identical, which would be absurd. So in explaining the motion of a single individual, the opponent is stuck with two movers.
This argument clearly can be understood as the start of an infi- nite regress. It is not at all elear whether Nagarjuna so intended it, as the context in which the argument is formulated is one in which
￼128 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
the consequence that two movers emerge in the analysis of the motion of a single mover is enough to refute the opponent.36 But it is important to see that once this multiplication of explanatory motions and agents begins, it cannot be stopped, and so this argu- ment constitutes a                  attack on a view according to which motion is an entity associated with movers. lt is also worth noting that the argument generalizes in other ways: lt can be for- mulated as an argument against a parallel analysis of change as an independent property and, in          as an argument against prop- erties as entities that inhere in subjects-a twofold redness is re- quired for a red shirt to be red because of the possession of red- ness. So this is, in fact, a "third man" argument.
7. If without a mover
It would not be correct to say that there is motion, Then if there were no motion,
How could there be a mover?
Niigiirjuna is here emphasizing the codependence of motion and the mover. If there areno movers, there is no motion. If there is no motion, there are no movers. This has import at both the conven- tional level and with respect to any discussion of the inherent existence of either the mover or motion. At the conventional level, it means that any analysis of either motion or the mover that leaves the other out, or that does not involve codependence, will fail. Neither can be established as an independent basis for the analysis of the other. But it also means that neither, therefore, can be thought to inherently exist since to exist inherently would be to exist independently.
8. Inasmuch as a real mover does not move,
And a nonmover does not move,
A part from a mover and a nonmover, What third thing could move?
36. The commentaries I have consulted are silent on this issue, and there is no consensus among the Tibetan. scholars with whom I have worked regarding this issue.
￼Examination ofMotion 129
Here the terms "mover" and "nonmover" must be understood in
the context of the previous arguments. Niigiirjuna is clearly talking about entities that are essentially in motion or in nonmotion. He has argued that we cannot think of a thing in motion as a thing whose nature is to move. And clearly a thing whose nature is not to move cannot be in motion. So if motion is thought of as a property that is either part of the nature of a thing or incompatible with a thing's nature, we are left with the conclusion that there is no motion. And so we have a philosophical problem: How is ordinary motion (and change) possible? Niigiirjuna emphasizes this in the following verses:
9. When without motion,
It is unacceptable to call something a mover. How will it be acceptable
To say that a mover moves?
10. For bim from whose perspective a mover moves, There would be the consequence that
Without motion there could be a mover. Because a mover moves.
These verses recapitulate the argument in II: 4 and II: 7. If we simply regard motion and mover as independent phenomena, we are forced to the absurd consequence that either could be present without the other.
11. lf a mover were to move,
There would be a twofold rnotion:
One in virtue of whieh he is a mover,
And one in virtue of whieh the mover moves.
This last verse recapitulates the important argument in II: .6 in preparation for the attack on the possibility of the beginning and end of motion. The next few verses are reminiscent both of Zeno of Elea and Sextus Empiricus:
12. Motion does not begin in what has moved, Nor does it begin in what has not moved, Nor does it begin in what is moving.
In what, then, does motion begin?
￼130 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
13. Prior to the beginning of motion, There is no beginning of motion in
The going or in the gone.
How could there be motion in the          
These two verses are alternative formulations of the same argu- ment: If there is motion, it musi begin sometime. But thai moment is inconceivable. For motion doesn't begin in a stationary thing. And once a thing is in motion, it is too late. lt can't always have begun in the past or be yet to begin, and there simply isn't time to go anywhere in the present.
14. Since the beginning o f motion Cannot be conceived in any way,
What gone thing, what going thing,
And what nongoing thing can be posited?
After having emphasized this point, Niigiirjuna points out thai all that has been said about motion (and hence implicitly about change) applies, mutatis mutandis, to rest (and hence implicitly to stasis). Things thai are in motion cannot be simultaneously at rest. But to say thai a stationary thing is at rest, where rest is conceived as a property or eolity having independent existence, would in- volve us in the same paradoxes encountered above: The stasis itself would have to be either in motion or at rest. If in motion, then the static thing would have to be in motion, which is contradictory. But if at rest, then it must be at rest in virtue of possessing stasis, and we are off on the same regress:
15. Just as a moving thirig is not stationary, A nonmoving thing is not stationary.
Apart from the moving and the nonmoving,
What third thing is stationary?
16. l f without motion
It is not appropriate to posit a mover,
How could it be appropriate to say
That a moving thing is stationary?
￼Examination of Motion 131 And, in the same fashion, all that applies to the initiation of
motion applies mutatis mutandis, to its cessation:
17. One does not halt from moving,
Nor from having moved or not having moved. Motion and coming to ·rest
And starting to move are similar.
Niigiirjuna now develops further problems with any view regard- ing motion as an entity; it must be either identical to or different from the mover. Both options, he will argue, turo out to be incoher- ent:
18. That motion just is the mover itself
Is not correct.
Nor is it correct that
They are completely different.
19. lt would follow from
The identity of mover and motion
That agent and action Are identical.
The identity of agent and action is absurd on its face. For then whenever an agent were to perform another act, s/he would be- come a distinct agent. There would be no basis for identifying individuals over time.
20. lt would        frolJl
A real distinction between motion and mover That there could be a mover without motion And motion without a mover.
This is more complicated. lt is important to recall that the target positions here are positions that reify motion as a distinct entity, however abstract. lf motion were an entity, and were distinct from all movers, then it should be possible to separate motion from
￼132 THE TEXT     COMMENTARY
movers.37 Then we should see motion when nothing is moving and movers that are not in motion. Noticing that this is a problem for Nagarjuna's opponent provides us with a hint as to the positive account of conventional motion that we should take from this chap- ter to be discussed below: Motion can only be understood in rela- tion to movers-as a relation between their positions at different times. Movers can only be understood as movers in relation to motion so understood. But to understand motion and movers this way is not to reify them as entities-and so to escape the dilemma of their. identity or difference. Nagarjuna emphasizes this       in the next verse, where we must read "established" as meaning estab- lished as existent entities.
21. When neither in identity Nor in difference
Can they be established,
How can these two be established at all?
22. The motion by means of which a mover is manifest Cannot be the motion by means of which he moves. He does not exist before that motion,
So what and where is the thing that moves?
In this verse and in the next, Nagatjuna is simply emphasizing the interdependence of motion and the mover. In II: 22 he notes the absurdity of the supposition that the mover and the motion are known independently. I f they could be, then the mover would have to have one motion in virtue of which he was a mover and a second independent motion in virtue of which he now moves. But since prior to being in motion, no mover exists, it cannot be that the mover exists as a mover independently of the motion. This then demands an answer to the question, What moves?
In II: 23 Nagarjuna answers this in a very straightforward way: The mover who is a mover in virtue of his motion (and that motion is a motion in virtue of being carried out by a mover) is what moves. Hence, the mover is dependent for his identity as a mover
37. The principle herc is the familiar Humean maxim of metaphysical analysis: Whatever is really distinct is in principle separable.

on the motion; the motion is dependent for its identity on the mover. Neither has an intrinsic identity, and both are empty of inherent existence:
23. A mover does not carry out a different motion
From that by means of which he is manifest as a mover. Moreover, in One mover
A twofold motion is unacceptable.

The three ways in question are past, present, and future. Some- thing that is inherently a mover has been shown to be incapable of motion in any of these periods. This is simply a way ofemphasizing the mora! of the entire chapter: Movers cannot be thought of as being movers intrinsically. Moreover, nonexistent movers-movers that are not even conventionally movers-certainly don't move. It must therefore be that neither do movers move intrinsically nor that there is no motion. There musi be a sense in which motion and movers exist, but do not do so intrinsically. The       verse must hence be read with "entity," "nonentity," and ''existent" as asserted in the ultimate sense:
25. Neither an enJ:ity nor a nonentity
Moves in any of the three ways.
So motion, mover,
And route are nonexistent.
So far so good. But then is motion completely nonexistent? Is the entire universe static according to Madhyamika philosophy? If we simply read this chapter in isolation, that conclusion might indeed seem warranted. It would be hard to distinguish emptiness from complete nonexistence. We would be left with an illusory world of change and movement, behind which would !ie a static ultimate reality. But such a reading would be problematic. For one thing, it would be absurd on its face. Things move and change. For
￼134 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
another, it would contradict the doctrine of dependent origination and change thai is the very basis of any Buddhist philosophical system, which Niigiirjuna has already endorsed in the opening chap- ter. How, then, are we to read this discussion more positively? Answering this question is hermeneutically critical not only for an understanding of this chapter, but for a reading of the entire text, which if not read with care, can appear unrelentingly nihilistic.
The positive account we are after emerges when we read this second chapter in the context of the first chapter: All phenomena, including motion, are dependently arisen and, hence, empty of inherent existence. The conclusion thai motion is empty is simply the conclusion thai it is conventional and dependent, like the puta- tively moving entities themselves. Since there is no implicit con- trastive, inherently existent, ultimate reality-say of the static, or of stasis-this conclusion does not lead us to ascribe a "second. class" or merely apparent exislence to motion or to movers. Their nonexistence is simply their lack of existence as substantial en- tities. Existence-of a sort-is hence recovered exactly in the con- text of an absence of inherent existence.
But existence of what kind? Herein lies the clue to the positive construction of motion thai emerges. The existence thai emerges is a conventional and dependent existence. Motion does not exist as an entity on this account, but rather as a relation-as the relation between the positions of a body at distinct times and, hence, as dependent upon that body and those positions.38 Moreover, it emerges as a conventional entity in the following critical sense: Only to the extent thai we make the decision to identify, as a single entity, things that differ from each other in position over time, but are in other respects quite similar and form causal chains of a particular sort, can we say thai whatever is so identified moves. And this is a matter of choice. For we could decide to say thai entities thai differ in any respect are thereby distinct. If we did adopt thai convention for individuation, an entity here now and one there then would ipso facto be distinct entities. And so no single entity could adopt differ- ent positions (or different properties) at different limes, and so motion and change would be nonexistent. li is this dependence of

motion on the moved, of the status of things as moved on their motion, and of both on conventions of individuation that, on this account, constitutes their emptiness. But this simply constitutes their conventional existence and provides an analysis of the means by which they so exist. The emptiness of motion is hence seen to be its existence as conve.ntional and as dependent, not other than its conventional existence. In understanding its emptiness in this way, we bringmotion, change, and movable and changeableentities back from the brink of extinction.39
39. Again,theaffi.nitiestoHumeareintriguing:TheHumeananalysisofexter- nal physical objects and of personal identity appears at first to deny the reality of either. But what emerges from amore careful reading is that Hume shows that only the reified substantialist versions of objects and selves arc nonexistent. The objects and selves with which we have actual perceptual and cognitive commerce, on his view, arc          existent, but only in vinue of being dependent upon conventions („eustom") for their identity and existence. It is a elear analysis of their conven- tional character that allows us to coherentJy assen their existence.
￼Chapter III Examination of the Senses
In this chapter, which is most immediately about vision, Nagarjuna really addresses the status of sense perception generally, as he makes elear in the opening and closing verses. Just as in Chapter Il, where the target positions Nagarjuna argues against are posi- tions according to which motion and the mover inherently exist as distinct, independent, but somehow related entities, here he ar- gues against positions according to which the sense faculties, the sense organs, the subject of sensory experience, and the sense object inherently exist and are distinct, independent, but somehow related entities. For we do perceive motion and change, and the argument for the conventional existence of motion did suggest thai it could be seen as a relation between the positions at which we perceive objects at different limes. So one can imagine an oppo- nent saying, "Even if the motion we perceive is not real, the per- ception must be." Again, it will be important for Nagarjuna that his analysis of perception as empty of inherent existence, and as rrierely dependently arisen, does not entail its complete nonexis- tence. He musi, that is, steer a middle path between reification and nihilism using emptiness as his compass.
1. Seeing, hearing, smelling, Tasting, touching, and mind
Are the .six sense faculties.
Their spheres are the visible objects, etc. . . .
￼Examination ofthe Senses 137
This is a standard Buddhist catalog of the sense faculties. It differs from the standard Western catalog only in that the Bud- dhists regard introspection literally as an inner sense with the same epistemic structure as outer senses and presumably subserved by analogous physical structures. Niigiirjuna will not dispute the real- ity of these faculties or of their respective spheres. But he will insist that that reality must be characterized interdependently and conventionally.
2. That very seeing does not see Itself at all.
How can something that cannot see itself See another?
This cryptic argument is aimed at any theory according to which vision is inherently existent. The idea is this: If the visual faculty were to be inherently existent, then seeing would be its essence. lts action would hence require no distinct conditions and no external object to be seen. That is, if vision were inherently existent, vision would occur simply in virtue of the existence of the visual faculty. Suppose then that there is an inherently existent visual faculty and no external sense object for it. lt would then have only itself as a possible object of sight, yet it would be seeing and so would have to be seeing itself. Therefore, Niigiirjuna argues, a view of vision as inherently existent would entail the possibility of visual appercep- tion. But there is no such possibility. So the fact that vision can see other things cannot be in virtue of its containing percipience as an inherent property.
There is also a plausible Pyrrhonian interpretation of this verse: The point of a sensory faculty is to make knowledge possible. But that is only possible if the data the faculty provides are them- selves perceived. But the data that the visual faculty delivers are visual. If they themselves are to be perceived, one would require either another visual faculty, hence generating a vicious regress, or apperception by vision, which is absurd. The point is not then that vision is impossible, but rather that visual perception-or any kind of perception-can only be completely explained and characterized by reference to things outside of the visual faculty

itself. Vision is relational, and not an intrinsically identifiable
phenomenon. 40
3. The example offire
Cannot elucidate seeing.
Along with the moved and not-moved and motion That has been answered.
This is a reply to a standard substantialist counterexample to a Madhyamika analysis, specifically: Fire bums other things, but does not bum itself. And it can be intrinsically identified. Perhaps then vision is like fire, in thai it can see others but not itself, while it does not need to be relationally identified. This example is a standard in early Buddhist debates about intrinsic versus relational identity, and Nagarjuna devotes an entire chapter to its refutation as a dialectical device (Chapter X), arguing there that fire cannot be intrinsically identified. But at this point, he is willing to grant the opponent that premise for the sake of argument. For, he claims, its utility as an analogy has alr,eady been undermined by the argument in the second chapter.
How? Whatever fire is buming must be bumed in the past, the future, or the present. But, as with motion, buming cannot be, by its very nature, in the past, on pain of regress. Nor can it be in the future for the same reason. But buming cannot take place in the present either, for there is not enough time in an instant for any- thing to bum. Mutatis mutandis for vision. In the case of vision, for Nagarjuna, there is a further problem with vision of another in the present. The visual process-and any sensory process-takes time. So if vision is seeing another thing, the other thing is already past. The only thing thai vision could see in the present is a visual sense-impression. But then we are back to the problem of visual apperception. So even if fire were intrinsically identifiable, there is
40. I am indebted to the Ven. Gen Lobzang Gyatso for my readingof this verse. Kalupahana (1986) reads this quite differently-as an empiricist rejection of a Cartesian cogito argument. White I agree that Nagarjuna has no sympathy with a Cartesian posicion, to see this verse as articulating an empiricist view with regard to self-knowledge seems unmotivated.
￼Examination of the Senses 139
no point at which il could bum another. And if vision were intrinsi- cally identifiable, there would be no moment at which it could see another.
4. When there is not even the slightest
Nonseeing seer,
How could it makes sense to say That seeing sees?
When all there is to vision is visual perception, what is the motiva- tion for positing an entity to undertake the process of perception? All there is to vision is the perceptual process: We don't need to posil an entity-the visual faculty over and above the set of interde- pendent phenomena thai subserve vision. The desire to do so is of a piece with the more         substantialist imperative to posil an independent substratum to support every capacity or property.
5. Seeing itself does not see. Nonseeing itself does not see.
Through seeing itself
The elear analysis of the seer is understood.
Perception is not accomplished by any independent entity known as vision. But thai doesn't mean thai things thai are incapable of sight thereby perceive. In order to know what the proper subject of vision is, it is important to undertake a careful analysis of the percep- tual process and not simply to posil a faculty with the nature of vision.
6. Without detachment from vision there is no seer. Nor is there a seer detached from it.
If there is no seer
How can there be seeing or the seen?
On Niigiirjuna's analysis, we can't make sense of an autonomous subject of visual perception. For sucha subject would by definition have its identity as a visual subject independent of perception. But there is no sense in calling something thai does not see a seer. On
￼140 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
the other hand, if we pack vision into its definition, we thereby fai! to identify the subject nonrelationally. Vision and its subject are thus relational, dependent phenomena and not substantial or inde- pendent entities. So neither seeing nor seer nor the seen (con- ceived of as the object of sense perception) can be posited as entities with inherent existence. The point is just that sense percep- tion cannot be understood as an autonomous phenomenon, but only as a dependent process.
7. Just as the birth of a son is said to occur
In dependence on the mother and father,
So consciousness is said to arise Independence on the eye and          form. 41
Here the opponent offers yet another argument in favor of the inherent existence of the visual faculty (and, by extension, the other sense faculties): Consciousness is a consequence of vision, and it surely exists-in fact, its existence, one might say, is self- validating. Given the reality of the effect, the cause must also be real.42 The       two verses reply to this objection and state the obvious generalization to all other senses, sense objects, sense faculties, and faculties of knowledge. The reply consists in pointing out that the other faculties and aggregates, including introspection and consciousness, exist and fail to exist in exactly the senses that vision and its objects exist and fai! to exist: All are empty of inher- ent independent existence. But all exist conventionally. So the effect that, according to this interlocutor, exists inherently and demands an inherently existent cause does not so exist. And in the sense that it exists, its causes also exist:
8. Prom the nonexistence of seeing and the seen it follows that
The other four faculties of knowledge do not exist.
41. The authenticity of this verse is a matter of dispute. It is not present in all editions of the text and may be a later interpolation.
42. AndfromthestandpointofaBuddhistanalysisofhumane:rdstencethereis more to it than this: In many presentations of the "twelve links of dependent origination," consciousness conditions craving for existence, which gives rise to existence in

Are the same way.
9. Like the seen, the heard, the smelled, The tasted, and the touched,
The hearer, sound, etc.,
And consciousness should be understood.
Again, the point of this chapter is emphatically not that there is
no perception, or that there areno sense faculties, sense organs, or
sense objects. Rather the point is that none of these can be ana- lyzed successfully as autonomous entities. They are interdepen- dent phenomena that depend for their existence and their char- acter on each other. None of them exists independently. They are all, hence, empty of inherent existence, and carving the process of perception into these components represents a conventional taxon- omy of a process that does not present itself with natural joints demanding cleavage on their own.
43. The skandhas (literally "heaps" or "piles," but most often translated as "aggregates") are the basie constituents of the personality. Five are typically identi- fied: fonn         matter-the physical body), sensation, perception, disposition (behavioral and cognitive), and consciousness. But the tenn "skandha" indicates two features of this decomposition that must be born in mind to avoid confusion: The division is practical and empirical, and not philosophically             and the skandhas thcmselvcs arc dccomposible into further hcaps, etc. These arc not, hence, ontological fundamentals, but rather the first level of a psychology.
￼ChapterIV Examination of the Aggregates
The five aggregates are the basie Buddhist categories of personal constituents. The first-thai discussed as an example in this chapter-is in Sanskrit rripa, in Tibetan gzugs. Unfortunately, given the lexicography of Westem philosophy, this word has histori- cally been translated as "form." This practice is so ubiquitous thai I am loathe to depart from it, despite the confusion it engenders. For what the word means is matter. The other aggregates are sensa- tion,            intellect, and the dispositions. li is important to realize thai this taxonomy is to be understood pragmatically: There is no deep doctrinal or philosophical point thai hangs on dividing the properties or capacities of humans up in just this way. In fact, most often the only important point about analysis in terms of the aggregates is thai humans are composite. The precise nature of the best decomposition is of interest to psychology and to soteriological practitioners, but is at bottom, from the standpoint of the tradition, an empirical matter.44
This chapter is motivated by the natural suggestion thai even if vision itself is empty, as was argued in the previous chapter, there musi be a       existent basis for vision in the person and his/her faculties. For the emptiness of vision was established in part by showing thai perception depends upon the perceiver and the per-
44. That is not, of course, to say that it is arbitrary.
￼Examination of the Aggregates 143
ceived. And that might seem to suggest thai these bases-or at least the most essential one, the perceiver-truly exist. For then one could say thai whereas vision itself is not inherently existent, it does exist as a relation between an inherently existent perceiver and an inherently existent object, or at least as a property of sucha perceiver, even if there is       no object.45 Niigiirjuna aims to demonstrate the emptiness of all of the constituents of the person by taking form as an example and applying arguments that are         in scope. Form is taken as an example precisely because it is the most solid, apparently nonempty of the aggregates-the one thai we are most likely to reify. So the program is to use arguments with application to any of the aggregates and to apply them to the hardest case. The conclusion Niigiirjuna is after is thai no decompo- sition of the person will yield constituents thai are themselves inde- pendent and nonempty.
I. Apan from the cause of form, Form cannot be conceived.
Apart from form,
The cause of form is not seen.
Niigiirjuna begins by making use of the results of the first chapter. Nothing arises causelessly, and no cause is ineffectual. So if any form exists, it exists with a cause. And if the cause of any form exists, so does thai form. But there is an interesting problem to be posed: How about form itself-matter considered in          not in its specific instances? Does it have a cause or not? This question is important because it gets at the question of whether we can imagine ultimate ontological categories thai ex- ist independently. If form has a cause at all, it musi be either the same or different from form. If the former, we have an infinite regress. If the latter, then we have the absurd conclusion that immaterial things can cause          things to come into
45. The reason for this second possibility is the possible presence of an idealist in the dialectical neighborhood, who might argue that even though neither seeing nor the scen inherently exists, both exist as illusions of the putative seer, who most exist, even if only as the subject of delusion.
￼144 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
existence. lf it has no cause, then il cannot be said to exist at
all. 46
2. If apart from the cause of form, there were form, Form would be without cause.
But nowhere is there an effect Without a cause.
lf form as such exists without any cause, we would have an example of an inherently existent category. But thai would also violate the principle of dependent origination. Thai is, both Niigiirjuna and his opponent agree thai all phenomena are depen- dently originated, and the discussion in the present chapter is in fact directed at figuring out just what          form depends on. So an attempt to posil          form as inherently existent on the grounds thai ii comes into existence causelessly is an ad hoc move that is unavailable to any participant in this debate.
Moreover, Niigiirjuna points out in the next verse, if we held form to be dependent upon a cause thai was itself inherently exis- tent, we would have an inherently existing cause without an inher- ently existing effect. Thai putative cause would, hence, fail to be a cause in the full sense. Between genuine causes and their effects there is a relation of dependence. For something to count as a cause independent of its producing an effect would be incoherent. But since in the context of inherent existence merely conventional existence counts as no existence at all, an inherently existent cause with a merely conventionally existent effect would count just as much as an ineffective cause. So neither can we make sense of an inherently existent. cause of the existence of          form if mate-      form is held not to be inherently existent.
46. We must understand "form" in this context to designate physical reality as a whole, including matter and energy. We can presume (bypassing hagiographic con- siderations) that Nagarjuna was unaware of the relativistic understanding of the interchangeability of these two; but it is elear that, from the standpoint of "skandha theory," the operative contrast is between the physical and the nonphysical. (And here, given the antisubstantial metaphysics in play, "nonphysical" does not mean made of spook stuff.) Form is just whatever is succeptible of physical description and explanation. Many kinds of supervenience are compatible with the decomposi- tion suggested by Buddhist psychology.
￼Examination ofthe. Aggregates 145
3. l f apart from form
There were a cause of form.
It would be a cause without an effect. But there are no causes without effects.
4. When form exists,
A cause of the arising of form is not tenable. When form is nonexistent,
A cause of the arising of form is not tenable.
Any relationship between form and a putative cause is unintelli- gible, Nagarjuna argues, following closely the reasoning in Chap- ter I. If form exists, the cause has ceased to exist. If form does not exist, the cause cannot have existed. This might seem at first glance to be a wholesale rejection of the possibility of depen- dency of effects on causal conditions. But if we recall the       of Chapter I and keep the dialectical context of the current chapter firmly in mind we will see that this is not so: The paradox of causal contact arises-as Sextus also notes-only if we suppose that the causes we appeal to in explanation must have some spe- cial force by means of which they bring about their effects. That, as we have seen, is the view of the causal link as inherently existent and, hence, of causes as inherently existent. The oppo- nent Niigiirjuna is attacking in this chapter is one who thinks that form/matter is inherently existent, but who has granted that all individual phenomena-all particular forms, such as human bod- ies, tables, and chairs-are dependently arisen. So the opponent agrees that all phenomena must be explicable. But the opponent wants to reify form, and that is to treat it as a phenomenon- albeit an inherently existent one. Therefore, it must, for the oppo- nent, have an explanation of its existence, and since its existence is inherent existence, it must be an explanation in terms of inher- ently existent causation. So all that Niigiirjuna has to do is to remind the opponent of the incoherence of that notion in order to undermine the view that form as such is inherently existent. The coherence of conventional dependent origination is not at issue.
5. Form itself without a cause Is not possible or tenable.
￼146 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY Therefore, think about form, but
Do not construct theories about form.
The       of these arguments, Nagarjuna concludes, is that we cannot think of form as such as an entity at all. Individual forms are entities-dependently arisen ones, hence, empty of inherent existence. But form itself is an abstraction, neither caused nor uncaused, but dependent upon the existence of          things with form. (Moreover, were one to argue that form itself exists as an entity, one would be faced with an uncomfortable dilemma: lts existence would be caused or uncaused. The latter altemative patently begs the question regarding the explanation of the exis- tence of the          world. But the former issues in a further dilemma: The cause would either itself be materia! or immaterial. On the first bom, we have an infinite regress; on the second, the inexplicable causation of the materia! by the immaterial.)47 So, he advises, think carefully about what form is and about the nature of particular          objects. But do not construct theories that purport to describe the essence of materia! form. For there is no such thing. lt is simply a characteristic of ·individual materia! ob- jects and, hence, something that depends upon their existence, with no essence of its own.
6. The assertion that the effect and cause are similar
Is not acceptable.
The assertion that they are not similar Is also not acceptable.
We cannot say that nonmaterial things give rise to the existence of matter, for that would be an inexplicable miracle. Nor can we say that matter gives rise to matter, since that would beg the ques- tion. But there is no other possibility. So despite the reificationist's intuition that though individual          objects may be empty, the matter they are made of is nonempty, we see that we cannot even clearly conceive of the nature of matter as such independently of materia! objects. Matter, too, is hence dependent and empty of

other aggregates:

And consciousness and all such things Should be thought of
In the same way as materia) form.
8. When an analysis is made through emptiness, If someone were to offer a reply,
That reply will fai!, since it will presuppose Exactly what is to be proven.
9. When an explanation is made through emptiness.
Whoever would find fauli with it
Will find no fault, since the criticism will presuppose Exactly what is to be proven.
In these last two oft-quoted verses, Niigiirjuna claims that once a demonstration of the emptiness of a phenomenon or class of phe- nomena has been produced, any reply will inevitably beg the ques- tion. And this is meant to have been demonstrated by the argument in this chapter in the following way: Once we have shown something to be empty of inherent existence, we have, ipso facto, shown it to be dependently arisen and merely conventionally real. Anything an opponent would want to demonstrate to be inherently existent would fali prey to the causal paradoxes developed in this chapter. That is, he must either assume that the thing is completely indepen- dent and causeless, which is, upon analysis, exactly equivalent to the conclusion he is out to prove, or that it arises from another inher- ently existent phenomenon. But then in order to demonstrate that fact, he musi demonstrate the inherent existence of that second phenomenon (as well as the inherent dependence relation between them-a kind of relation we have seen to be internally contradic- tory). And this is true no matter to which ontological category the putatively inherently existent phenomenon belongs.
That this is so should not be surprising, for the central thrust of Niigiirjuna's arguments thus far, and throughout Mu/amadhyama- kakiirikii, is not that inherent existence is a property some things might have had but by global accident is uninstantiated or that
￼148 THE 'tEXT AND COMMENTARY
emptiness just happens to characterize all phenomena. Rather he is arguing that inherent existence is simply an incoherent notion and that emptiness is the only possible analysis of existence. lt would follow straightforwardly that arguments for inherent exis- tence will be question begging.'"
48. Kalupahana (1986), p. 145, sees a different question being begged. He writes:
The argument in favor of dependence is experience. Hence, the person prcsent· ing a refutation of this idea should be in a position not only to negate "mutual dependence" but also io provide evidence for the establishment of a metaphysi- cal substance (svabhiva). This has not yet been achieved. Thus, according to Nigirjuna, what       remains to be proved is the thesis regarding "substance" rather than mutual dependence.
While this analysis is consistent with Kalupahana's interpretatiOn of NigArjuna as a pragmatically inclined empiricist, I do not sec it as an accurate rendering of the argument herc. In particular, it ignores the emphasis on emptiness in these venes.
￼ChapterV Examination of Elements
This chapter examines the ontological status of characteristics and the characterized, or in more familiar terms, properties and indi- viduals. The question, as always, is this: Does it make sense to think of either as existing independently, substantially, or funda- mentally? Or, on the other hand, are they mutually interdependent and therefore empty? The example Niigiirjuna chooses to focus on is space since it is one of the six primal elements according to classical Buddhist cosmology.49 lf he can show that these elements must be understood as neither inherently existing entities nor as inherently existing characteristics of entities, he will have shown that no ontological decompositioll of phenomena into their pri- mary constituents yields inherently existing constituents. More- over, according to some early Buddhist schools, each of the primal elements has a distinguishing characteristic and, hence, an essence. So, Niiglirjuna is addressing his opponent on the opponent's home turf. lf any entities or characteristics have essences, these do.
1. Prior to a characteristic"' of space There is not the slightest space.
49. The others are earth, water, fire, air, and consciousness.
SO. The sense of                 (mtsan nyid) is that of a distinguishing charac- teristic, or a characteristic      or signature of a thing. I therefore use the singular herc. (I owe this suggestion to the Ven. Gareth Sparham.) But the points that NAglrjuna makes are                  and could as well be made using "characteris- tks," as lnada (1970) and Kalupahana (1986) do.
￼150 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY If it arose prior to the characteristic
Theo it would, absurdly, arise without a characteristic.
Space cannot exist as a completely uncharacterized entity that then somehow acquires characteristics. Anything that exists has some properties and cannot be identified or characterized indepen- dently of them.
2. A thing without a characteristic Has never existed.
If nothing lacks a characteristic, Where do characteristics come to be?
So we can conclude that everything has characteristics. But maybe these characteristics exist inherently, independently of the things, and then come to be associated with them. On sucha view, while individuals would not have inherent existence, properties would.
3. Neither in the uncharacterized nor in the characterized Does a characteristic arise.
Nor does it arise
In something different from these two.
But there is a problem. If a characteristic were inherently exis- tent, it would have to become instantiated in either a characterized or an uncharacterized object. But there are no uncharacterized objects, and if the object already is characterized, there is no need for the characteristic to become instantiated. So to think of indi- viduals and properties as existing independently and then some- how coming together to constitute particulars makes no sense.
4. If characteristics do not appear,
Theo it is not tenable to posit the characterized object. If the characterized object is not posited,
There will be no characteristic either.
But if we were to go completely eliminativist with respect to characteristics, we would lose the ability to posit both actual ob-
￼Examination of Elements 151 jects with characteristics and characteristics that actual objects
share.
5. Prom this it         that there is no characterized And no existing characteristic.
Nor is there any entity
Other than the characterized and the characteristic.
In the first two lines of this verse, Niigiirjuna draws the conclu- sion that there are no inherently existent characteristics and no inherently existent characterized entities. Entities and their proper- ties are mutually dependent and, hence, empty of inherent exis- tence. But this does not mean, he emphasizes in the fina! two lines, that there is some other ontology of inherently existent basie types that could replace them. Indeed particulars can be thought of as characterized entities, with characteristics; but this does not entail the independent existence of entities of either of those types.
6. lf there is no existent thing,
Of what will there be nonexistence?
Apart from existent and nonexistent things Who knows existence and nonexistence?
Here Niigiirjuna generalizes the conclusion and indicates its larger ontological implications. Having shown that there are no inherently existent things, it might seem that it follows that all things are inherently nonexistent. But existence and nonexistence, after all, are characteristics. So it follows that neither existence nor nonexistence can be said to exist independently and hence to char- acterize, inherently, anything. Moreover, since no particulars can be said inherently to exist, and thereby characterized as inherently existing things, none can be said to be inherently nonexistent. Existence and nonexistence are hence themselves dependent, rela- tive characteristics. lt is, of course, important to recall that this entire dialectic is aimed at nonrelative understandings of existence and nonexistence. Niigiirjuna is not arguing that nothing exists in any sense and that nothing fails to exist in any sense. Rather, he is arguing that nothing exists in virtue of instantiating an indepen-
￼152 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
dently existent property of existence. Similarly, things do not fail
to exist in virtue of instantiating the property nonexistence.
7. Therefore, space is not an.entity.
It is not a nonentity.
Not characterized, not without character. The same is true of the other five elements.
Nagarjuna now retums to the example at hand to sum up the conclusions of the chapter. Things cannot be analyzed ontologi- cally as particulars existing independently of their properties. But this does not mean that individual things do not exist. They do not possess independently existing properties. But this does not mean that things are all propertyless.

This is the soteriological import of this discussion of fundamen- tal ontology: If one reifies phenomena-including such things as one's own self, characteristics (prominently including one's own), or external objects-and if one thinks that things either fail to exist or exist absolutely, one will be unable to attain any peace. For one will thereby be subject to egoism, the overvaluing of oneself and one's achievements and of          things. One will not appreciate the possibility of change, of the impermanence and nonsubstan- tiality of oneself and one's possessions. These are the seeds of grasping and craving and, hence, of suffering. The alternative, Nagarjuna suggests, and the path to pacification, is to see oneself and other entities as non-substantial, impermanent, and subject to change and not as appropriate objects of such passionate craving.
￼Chapter VI
Examination of Desire and the Desirous
This chapter represents a continuation of the discussion begun in the previous one. That is, while the chapter is nominally about desire, an example chosen for its obvious soteriological signifi- cance, it is in a larger sense a further discussion of the relation between entities and their properties, with specific attention to the relation between human beings and their psychological characteris- tics. Locating the discussion at this point is consonant with a tradi- tion of Mahiiyiina discussions of emptiness in which one first ad- dresses external phenomena, which are both easier to analyze and less succeptible of reification than the self, and then generalizes the discussion to human psychological phenomena.s1 The chapter opens with an echo of the discussion of space:
1. If prior to desire
And without desire there were a desirous one, Desire would depend on him.
Desire would exist when there is a desirous one.
51. See, e.g„ the Heart Siitra, with its famous discussion of the emptiness of the aggregates that begins with form and then moves to the psychological aggregates.
￼154 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
One possibility for the relationship between the subject of desire and the desire is that the desirous one exists qua desirous one independently of the desire, which is then adventitious and depen· dent. That is, on this view the desirous one is inherently desirous, but the desire is merely dependent. This, however, is problematic, for then there is a real contras! in the mode of existence of the desirous one and the desire: The desirous one       exists, but the desire does not       exist. But if there is no real desire, in virtue of what is there a desirous one?
2. Were there no desirous one, moreover, Where would desire occur?
Whether or not desire or the desirous one exist, The analysis would be the same.
But if there is no desirous one, there is no ontological basis for the desire. So whether we posil an inherently existent desirous one or no desirous one at all, we cannot identify desire as existing. And, of course, this goes for any characteristic or psychological attribute and for any subject of any such attribute identified under any description. Moreover, the converse is also true: Whether or not we posil inherently existent desire, we cannot thereby establish the existence of a substantially existent desirous one. If the desire does not exist inherently but only dependently, that dependence in no way presupposes an independent basis. If on the other hand desire is posited as inherently existent, there would be no need for a basis in a desirous one at all. In neither case would the substan- tial existence of the entity in question (subject or attitude) have any import for the reality of the correlative entity (attitude or subject). And the reason for this is simply that inherent existence is not relational existence. Since desire and the desirous one must be understood as interrelated, they must be understood as mutually dependent.
3. Desire and the desirous one Cannot arise together.
In that case, desire and the desirous one
Would not be mutually contingent.
￼Examination of Desire and the Desirous 155
Another possibility the opponent might suggest is this: Desire and the desirous one come into inherent existence at the same time. lt is very important in following this argumentto remember Niigiirjuna's dialectical task. The opponent against whom his reduc- tios are aimed is one who attributes inherent existence either to the desirous one, to desire, or both. Nagarjuna is only attempting to show that attributing to them that kind of existence is incoherent- not that there is no desire and that there are no desirous people at all. That would be crazy. Fundamental to the Buddhist conception of the predicament of human existence is the centrality of craving to the arising of suffering. But also fundamental is the conviction that there can be a release from craving. That is only possible, however, if craving is dependently originated since only then could the conditions that determine its arising be eliminated. So it is critically important from a Buddhist perspective to come to a com- plete understanding of the nature of desire, and the mode of its existence, and it would be inconceivable to deny its existence com- pletely. But Nagarjuna is emphasizing here that that understanding musi reveal them as mutually dependent in order to avoid the absurd conclusion that either could exist without the other. That precludes the assertion that while they in fact always co-occur, thai co-occurrence is not through interdependence, but through contin- gent simultaneity of independent phenomena.
Nagarjuna's claim in VI: 3 is also the conclusion of the argument thai is about to follow. lt proceeds by means of a destructive di- lemma. Given .that the opponent must have desire and the desirous one arising simultaneously, they must be either identical or differ- ent. Nagarjuna will show that neither altemative is coherent; VI: 4 spells out this strategy:
4. In identity there is no simuitaneity.
A thing is not simultaneous with itself. But if there is difference,
Theo how would there be simultaneity?
In the first line of this verse, Nagarjuna points out the relational character of simultaneity. If simultaneity is predicated, it must be predicated of two distinct things that arise at the same time. We
￼156 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
don't say that a thing arises simultaneously with itself. But if things are completely distinct in nature, they cannot co-occur in the same place, that is; if desire and the desirous one had distinct essences, they couId not be in the same place at the same time.
5. If in identity there were simultaneity, Then it could occur without association. If in difference there were simultaneity, It could occur without associatiOn.
The first claim is meant to be a reductio on the view thai simultaneous things can be identical. For suppose that there was an apparent pair of events whose simultaneity was in question, say William Clinton's uttering of the oath of office of the presi- dency and the inauguration of the first president from Arkansas. If there is every rea.son to believe that these events are distinct but occur at the same time, it is then appropriate to say thai they are simultaneous. But if we know thai there is in fact only one event, it is at best a joke to assert its simultaneity with itself. The proper thing to say then would be not that the oath taking was simultaneous with the inauguration but that it was identical to the inauguration. The term translated as "association" here (grogs- pa) can also mean friendship, or companionship-the idea is of something distinct but accompanying. For the inauguration and the oath taking to be associated would be for them to be, say, accompanying rituals that could in principle occur independently. But if they could occur independently, they cannot be identical. Simultaneity requires association of some kind. But identity is incompatible with association.
The second claim is meant to be a reductio on the view that simultaneous and associated things could be different in nature. Difference, like identity, is incompatible with association, though for a different reason. The kind of difference at issue here is essen- tial difference. Niigiirjuna's claim is that things that are completely different from one another, that are completely independent, ipso facto, stand in no relation to one another and so are not associ- ated. This is another application of the Humean (and Tractarian) argument Niigarjuna has mobilized above: If phenomena are
￼Examination of Desire and the Desirous 157
distinct-indeed, being simultaneous, they are not even argued to be causally related-they can be imagined to be separate. So they are then logically independent. But that would then entail thai if desire and the desirous one were different in this strong sense, we could imagine a desirous one without desire, and vice versa. But thai is of course absurd. So if desire and the desirous one are supposed to arise simultalleously, they can neither be identical nor different. Of course, since any inherently different entities, in vir- tue of having determinate natures, are either identical or different, il follows that desire or the desirous one are either nonsimultane- ous or empty of inherent existence.
6. If in difference there were simultaneity,
How could desire and the desirous one,
Being different, be established?
1f they were, they would be simultaneous.
This last verse emphasizes and spells out the point scouted above: We are left with a hard Choice once we conceive of desire and the desirous one as entities. If desire and the desirous one are conceived as substantially different but simultaneous, we would have to be able to establish the nature and existence of each inde- pendent of the other. That is no easy task. If we could accomplish it, simultaneity would be a satisfactory solution to the dilemma. But of course we cannot. Moreover, Niigiirjuna argues in the next verse, if they are completely different, we are left with the peculiar task of explaining why they always go together. And asserting their simultaneity forces this problem:
7.
8.
If desire and the desirous one
Are established as different, Then why would you think That they are simultaneous?
Since difference is not established,
lf you assert that they are simultaneous, Since they are established as simultaneous, Do you also assert that they are different?
￼158 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
We have not established-nor could we-that desire and the desirous one are substantially different. But the opponent wishes to assert their simultaneity. Given the entailment of difference by simultaneity as per the argument above, this would force the oppo- nent to assume the impossible burden of demonstrating this sub- stantial difference.
The whole quandary is summed up in VI: 9. Since we can't establish their difference in entity, we can't establish the claim that desire and the desirous one arise as distinct, simultaneous phenom- ena. We don't even have two phenomena to serve as the relata of difference:
9. Since nothing different has been established, If one is asserting simultaneity,
Which different thing
Do you want to say is simultaneous?
The conclusion, as stated in the special case in the preceding verse, is generalized in the       verse of the chapter. Once we think of entities and their properties-in particular, ourselves and our characteristics-as independently characterized things, we can make no sense of how they fit together temporally, logically, or ontologically. It is important that objects and their characteristics, persons and their states, be unified. But if we introduce essence and entity into our ontology, this will be impossible:
10. Tuus desire and the desirous one
Cannot be established as simultaneous or not simultaneous. So, like desire. nothing whatever
Can be established either as simultaneous or as
nonsimultaneous.
As always, however, we must remind ourselves of the sense of the conclusion and of its dialectical context. There is no denial here of the possibility of simultaneity, of the existence of desire, or 'of the possibility of desirous persons. Rather, there is a denial that any of these things make sense in the context of inherent existence.
￼ChapterVII Examination of the Conditioned
Having begun the text with an examination of the          of depen- dency between phenomena, and having then conducted an          of the                         constituents of reality, Nagarjuna now brings these two          together in a long chapter investigat- ing the nature of the world of conditioned things as a        The target position is the view that dependent arising         as well as             arisen things, are either            existent or com-         nonexistent. There are really two positions here with which Nagarjuna must contend: First, the reiticationist opponent charges
.that even if we grant Nagarjuna's earlier arguments for the conclu- sion that phenomena            are empty because they are de-           arisen, dependent arising itself must            exist. For      if phenomena are       dependently arisen, one might argue, are they       empty. Second, Nagarjuna must answer the following objection: If dependent arising is empty, then arising, stasis, and cessation are nonexistent. Hence there are, in fact, no phenomena since phenomena are                      in a Bud- dhist context-as those things that arise, remain, and cease. But         there are        empirical phenomena; indeed, such phe- nomena must exist for Nagarjuna's claim that they are empty to make any sense at all. How can this be reconciled with the empti- ness of dependent arising?
￼160 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
1. If arising were produced"
Theo it would also have the three characteristics.
lf arising is not produced,
How could the characteristics of the produced exist?
The three characteristics in question are arising, stasis, and cessa- tion. On a standard Buddhist view, all phenomena come into being in dependence upon conditions, remain in existence dependent upon conditions, and cease to exist dependent upon conditions. This is the core of the two central doctrines of dependent arising and impermanence. Niigiirjuna here poses a problem: If depen- dent arising itself were produced by conditions, then it itself would have these three characteristics and, apparently paradoxically, be impermanent. This is prima facie paradoxical just because if depen- dent arising is impermanent, it would appear that sometimes things don't arise dependently, which contradicts the thesis that all phe- nomena are dependently arisen. Moreover, as Niigiirjuna will ar- gue below, this assertion threatens a vicious regress-if arising arises, there must already be arising in virtue of which it does so.
But, Niigiirjuna asks in the third and fourth lines, if dependent arising is not produced, where did it come from? I f one were to say that dependent arising were not produced and, hence, that it does not depend for its existence on anything else, this would appear to contradict the thesis that everything arises dependently. Depen- dent arising itself, would then be the counterexample to the thesis.
2. Ifthe three, arising, etc., are separate,
They cannot function as the characteristics of the produced. But how cou]d they be joined
In one thing simultaneously?
52. "dubyed."Thistermissometimesappropriatelytranslatedas"disposition." "action," or "compounded." Context is crucial in determining which rendering is best. In Buddhist metaphysics these meanings are closely connected. Kalupahana (1986) uses "conditioned," though he interprets this to mean "conditioned by dispo- sitions." He argues that this chapter is closely connected to the previous chapter iri that lust "is operative in the perceptual process especially in the formation of ideas derived from experience." He argues that this chapter is devoted to an eutmination of the way phenomena such as desire determine the formation of ideas from "the b\ooming, buzzing confusion"' of sense e1tperience (p. 159). I find this reading unsupported by the text.
￼Examination ofthe Conditioned 161
These three characteristics, if they characterize the phenomenon of dependent arising itself, must either be present separately or together. This furnishes the basis of a destructive dilemma. If they are separate, then some parts of dependent arising have one of the three; some another. Some are arising; some abiding; some ceasing. But this is problematic since all phenomena are said to arise, to abide, and to cease.53 So it would seem to be the case that if depen- dent arising itself has all three of these characteristics, it cannot have them separately, but must have them jointly and simultaneously.
But the three characteristics could not be present simultaneously since they are mutually contradictory. At any one point, depen- dent arising could have only one of them. The same thing cannot be-in the same sense, at the same time-arising and ceasing when these are understood in the sense at issue here, that intro- duced by the substantialist opponent. lt is important in order to understand this argument to keep the dialectical context firmly in mind. The opponent throughout the text, whether on the nihilist side or on the reificationist side, considers existence to be inherent existence and predication to be the ascription of really existent properties to substantial bases. For the i:&gt;pponent Nagarjuna has in mind here, dependent arising-if it is the nature of things at all- must inherently exist. lt must therefore have the three characteris- tics inherently. To have a characteristic inherently is to have it essentially. But then dependent arising, for the opponent, would have a contradictory set of essential properties.
53. Moreover, one would not want to· say that sometimes dependent arising is arising, sometimes abiding, sometimes ceasing. The whole Buddhist picture of im- permanence is one according to which these processes are always co-occurring. But this dialectical move is not available to Nagarjuna at this stage of the discussion. lt would beg the question in. a critical sense: The properties under analysis herc, as Well as dependent arising itself, are introduced by the opponent as candidates for inherent existence· and as components of an analysis of the ultimate nature of phenomena. In the sense that they are deployed in a positive Buddhist account of the nature of conventional reality-the sense in which all phenomena are constantly arising in some sense, abiding through change in another, and ceasing in yet another-neither the phenomena to which these predicates are applied, nor the properties ascribed, are inherently existent. Quite the contrary; this is an analysis that is designed to demonstrate the lack of inherent existence of phenomena and their characteristics. It is important throughout the discussion that follows to bear in mind that Nagiirjuna is not subjecting this view to criticism, but iis substantialist cousin.
￼162 THE TEXT :A.ND COMMENTARY
3. If arising, abiding, and ceasing
Have characteristics other than those of the produced,
There would be an infinite regress.
I f they don'!, they would not be produced.
The other possibility is that dependent arising has some other eharaeteristies-that is, eharaeteristies other than those that all phe- nomena have in virtue of being dependently arisen. But we could then ask about the characteristics of those eharacteristies. Do those charaeteristies arise, abide, or perish? If so, the original regress has not be.en stopped. Another possibility is that arising, abiding, and perishing do not have eharaeteristies at all. But if not, then they are not phenomena in any ordinary sense atall. While that wouId cut off the regress, it would do so without aehieving any explanation, orany analysis of the kind           sought, and would leave an uneomfort- able paradox: We started seeking an understanding of dependent arising as inherently existent. But its inherent existence requires the inherent existence of arising, cessation, and stasis, all ofwhich now come out to be ontologieally sui generis. The further paradox is this: For dependent arising to exist inherently, these three should tum out to be essential properties of all phenomena. But on the alterna- tive under eonsideration, they are not properties at all.
We might, of eourse, try to extend this horn of the dilemma by suggesting that although arising, abiding, and ceasing are not phe- nomena in the ordinary sense, they are eharacteristics of sonie spe- cial kind. We then seem to have amore curious regress; new ad hoc eharaeteristies arise at eaeh level of analysis. The regress here is an interesting one because its vieiousness eonsists not in the same basis being required for each putatively basie posit, but in there being no prineiple available to determine a basis for any putative basie posil despite a principle that urges that there must be one. The point that Niigiirjuna is after, of eourse, is that this principle itself-that there must be an explanatory basis, an independent entity that has eharae- teristies, as an explanation of the occurrenee of any charaeteristie- is what generates the regress and must be rejected.
There is, of course, a third alternative. These three might nei- ther have charaeteristies different from those possessed by ordi- nary phenomena nor have no eharaeteristics at all: They might
￼Examination of the Conditioned 163
indeed have the very trio of characteristics that all ordinary phe- nomena have, namely, arising, abiding, and ceasing. lt is this alter- native that occupies Niigiirjuna for the remainder of the chapter. This alternative is interesting dialectically in thai, on the one hand, it represents the most natura! way to approach an analysis of depen- dent arising, namely, by consistently predicating it of everything, hence suggesting that it is indeed a candidate for an essence of things. On the other hand, as we shall see, thai very move pre- cludes treating it as a genuine essence since essences turn out to lack precisely the properties thai we must universalize here.
4. The arising of arising only gives rise To the basie arising.
The arising of the basie arising Gives rise to arising.
This is the opponent speaking. He suggests that dependent aris- ing arises from amore basie arising. This basie arising comes to be, but not on the basis of anything else. The idea, defended by some. earlier Buddhist schools, is this: There are two levels of dependent arising. The more superficial is the relationship of mutual depen- dence of all phenomena, issuing in their impermanence. But this interdependence, on this view, is itself dependently arisen. lt de- pends on a basie arising-a mere fact of interdependent origina- tion, which gives rise to the more specific empirical relations we see. So in the first two lines of this verse, the opponent says that when arising itself is considered in isolation, all thai we have is the basie arising. In the third and fourth lines, the opponent says that when that arising has arisen, it gives rise to the more superficial ordinary dependent arising. lt is, then, that basie arising thai is posited as ontologically foundational.
5, If, as you say, the arising of arising Gives rise to the basie arising,
How, according to you, does this,
Not arisen from the basie arising, give rise to that?
But Niigiirjuna makes the obvious move in reply: Does the basie
arising arise from a more basie arising, or is it somehow unarisen
￼164 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
(eternal or inexplicable)? If the former, then we seem to have an infinite regress; if the latter, a petitio principii. Niigiirjuna makes some of the numerous difficulties that aftlict this view explicit in the next two verses:
6. lf, as you say, that,which is arisen from basie arising Gives rise to the basis,
How does that nonarisen basis Give rise to it?
The account is either circular or regressive. lf the basie arising is held to arise in dependence on other dependently originated phe- nomena, and dependent arising is explained as dependent upon the basie arising, then the basis is posited as dependent upon that which it explains, and we have a vicious circle. If on the other hand the phenomena on whieh the basis depends are other than those it explains, and the phenomena themselves depend upon yet another basis, we have a vicious regress.
In the next verse, Niigiirjuna points out the question-begging alternative reading of the enterprise. He notes that one may ex- plain thai dependent arising arises through basie arising without eircles or regresses, but only by positing the basis as itself non- arisen. This, of course, flies in the face of the demand that moti- vates positing it in the first place-namely, the demand that every phenomenon, including dependent arising, be explained by some ontologieally more fundamental phenomenon:
7. If this nonarisen
Could give rise to thai,
Then, as you wish,
It will give rise to that which is arising.
The opponent now suggests another reply. Using the analogy of a lamp that illuminates both itself and others, he argues that aris- ing can give rise to itself and to others. This would, from the standpoint of the reificationist, have the happy consequence thai while other phenomena would be dependent on dependent arising, dependent arising would be independent and nonempty:
￼Examination ofthe Conditioned 165
8. Just as a butterlamp
Illuminates itself as well as others, So arising gives rise to itself
And to other arisen things.
Niigiirjuna now launches a lengthy critique of the example, argu- ing thai the relation between the butterlamp and what it illumi- nates is not one thai supports a notion of an inherently existent basis on which things that are not inherently existent can depend:
9. In the butterlamp and its place,
There is no darkness.
What thcn does the butterlamp illuminate?
For illumination is the clearing of darkness.
Here Niigiirjuna is emphasizing a disanalogy between the rela- tion between the butterlamp and what it illuminates, and the puta- tive relation between dependent arising and what it depends upon. The opponent who wields the example does so in order to demon- strate a difference in status between dependent arising and the dependently arisen. Dependent arising is meant not to be depen- dently arisen, despite the fact that all dependently arisen phenom- ena are. So the appropriate analogy in the case of the lamp would map this difference in status between being dependently arisen and being independent onto the difference between being illuminated and not being illuminated. The problem, though, is that in the example there is nothing that is not illuminated: Everything in the neighborhood of the lamp is illuminated just as is the lamp.
lt was standard philosophical fare in the Buddhist tradition within which Niigiirjuna was working to see darkness as a positive phenomenon. So to the extent that one adopted a reified ontology, darkness would be reified as easily as light. The .attack on the butterlamp analogy can thus effectively exploit the difficulties Niigiirjuna has already developed for theories that require inher- ently existent things to be related to one another. But it is impor- tant to see that even if one is not disposed to reify darkness, and regards it as the mere absence of light, to the extent that one reifies light, Nagiirjuna can argue that one will be compelled to reify
￼166 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
darkness as well. For if light exists inherently, then wherever light is not present it is essentially not present. And the essential nonpresence of light is essential darkness.
10. lf the arising butterlamp Does not reach darkness,
How could thai arising butterlamp
Have cleared the darkness?
Moreover, argues Niigiirjuna, the example itself does not bear close scrutiny as a case of an entity with some inherent power giving rise to a set of effects that depend upon it. For the task of the butterlamp is the clearing of darkness-or the production of illumi- nation. Now the production oflight and the clearing of darkness are, Niigiirjuna claims, equivalent. So, if the butterlamp illuminates ob- jects by its light reaching them, it should elear darkness by mearis of its light reaching darkness. But that would be for light and darkness to be present in the same place, which is contradictory.
11. lf the illumination of darkness occurs Without the butterlamp reaching darkness, All of the darkness in the world
Should be illuminated.
If it is not necessary, on the other hand, for the light of the butter- lamp to reach darkness in order to dispel it, since there is a lot of darkness in the world not reached by any single butterlamp, thai butterlamp should be capable of dispelling all of thai darkness.
12. lf, when il is illuminated,
The butterlamp illuminates itself and others, Darkness should, without a doubt,
Conceal        and others.
Finally, Niigiirjuna argues, if we are seriously to maintain that the butterlamp illuminates itself and others through a luminous essence, then since the essence of darkness is to conceal things, and things with such essences affect themselves and others, we should expect darkness to be self-concealing. But then we would not see darkness.
￼Examination o f the Conditioned 167
The point of all of this is not that we can't see lamps when they are lit or that we can when they aren't. Rather it is that the mecha- nism by which we see what we see when a lamp is lit is the same whether we are seeing the lamp or other things. To put it in contem- porary terms, photons reach our eyes from the lamp or from its ftame in the same way they do from the other physical objects in the neighborhood. And just as the visibility of the things in the neighborhood is dependent on a host of conditions, so is the visibil- ity of the lamp. So we do not have even an analogy to a case where the status of dependent arising would be distinct from that of the dependently arisen.
13. How could this arising, being nonarisen, Give rise to itself?
And if it is arisen from another,
Having arisen, what is the need for another arising?
Here Niigiirjuna is bringing us back to the original argument and reminding us of the reificationist's uncomfortable choice between a vicious regress and a begged question. If every arisen thing de- pends on an ontologically prior arising, we have an infinite regress. For each arising will require such a foundation. But if we cut off the regress by presupposing at some level a nonarisen dependent arising, we have to ask why thai level is exempt from the need for explanation. Niigiirjuna now announces the conclusion he will de- fend in the next section of the chapter:
14. The arisen, the non-arisen and that which is arising Do not arise in any way at all.
Tuus they should be understood
Just like the gone, the not-gone, and the going.
Recall the analysis of motion: Niigiirjuna argued that no entity answering to "motion" could be found in an entity that was in motion in the past, nor in an entity yet to move, nor in a currently moving entity. Motion bad to be understood relationally and not as an entity. Using similar reasoning, Niigiirjuna will now argue that arising cannot be found as an entity in something not yet arisen,
￼168 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
nor in something that has already arisen, ·nor in something yet to arise. Arising will also fail to be an entity and will have to be understood relationally. This will provide the key both to the refu- tation of the position that underlies both extreme positions-that for arising to exist, it must exist inherently-and to the construc- tion of a coherent positive account of dependent arising. The next three verses begin a sketch of dependent arising as empty, connect- ing this fact with the emptiness of dependently arisen phenomena:
15. When there is arising but not yet That which is arising,
How can we say that that which is arising Depends on this arising?
Niigiirjuna here suggests thai the way the reificationist has gone about posing the philosophical problem about the status of depen- dent arising itself is all wrong. The initial presumption at the basis of this debate is thai arisen entities arise from an independently existing process of dependent arising. But this is wrongheaded in at least two ways: First, phenomena arise from other phenomena, not from arising. So, for instance, if I strike a match, the fire emerges from the friction, the sulphur, the oxygen, my desire for light, and so forth, but not from dependent arising itself. That is a fact at a different level of analysis, which itself comprises the net- work of               just indicated. Second, if the existence of the process of arising antedates the existence of the arisen, it cannot be a sufficient condition or a complete explanation of the arisen. For if it were, the arisen would then exist. That being so, Niigiirjuna asks, "Why posil dependent arising itself as a phenomenon within the framework of dependent arising?"
16. Whatever is dependently arisen.
Such a thing is essentially peaceful.
Therefore that which is arising and arising itself Are themselves peaceful.
The sense of "peaceful" (zhi-ba) here is important. Niigiirjuna is asserting that things are not, from the ultimate point of view, in the constant flux of arising, remaining, and decaying that characterizes
￼Ex'amination ofthe Conditioned 169
them from the conventional point of view. This will be the conclu- sion of the extended argument that follows and is here merely announced in advance. But it is important at this stage to be elear about just what Niigiirjuna is asserting for it is indeed a delicate point: It is true that ordinarily and prereftectively, and sometimes as the result of bad philosophy, we tend to think of things as permanent and as having fixed essential natures. But a careful reftection on the nature of conventional phenomena shows them on analysis to be impermanent and, hence, to be characterized by the three properties of arising, stasis, and cessation.54
But while this takes us to a deeper understanding of the nature of phenomena, it does not take us all the way. For phenomena, having no essence, cannot have even these properties essentially. One way of seeing that is this: If we take the import of the three- fold nature of phenomena seriously, we see that the phenomena are themselves literally momentary. And if they are momentary, then there is literally no time for them to arise, to endure, or to decay. So from an ultimate point of view, the point of view from which they have no existence as extended phenomena at all, they do not possess these three properties. Hence no single real entity is in ftux. In this sense they are peaceful. Niigiirjuna points out the other way of seeing phenomena in the next verse: It does not follow from the fact that there are no inherently existent arisen entities that there are non-arisen ones. All phenomena are arisen, but they arise as empty, and as dependent. Coming to be just is arising, and all arising is dependent arising.
Niigiirjuna now tums his attention to an analysis of the three characteristics of arising, stasis, and cessation, showing of each in tum thai it cannot be understood as ontologically independent. He begins with arising:
17. If a nonarisen entity
Anywhere exists,
That entity would have to arise.
But if it were nonexistent, what could arise?
54. Such remarks also make it hard to sustain the nihilistic reading of the text Wood (1994) offers. For herc Nigirjuna is         committed to the claim that there arc dependently arisen phenomena.
￼170 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
We can exclude nonarisen entities from the analysis since the only sense thai we can make of the existence of any phenomenon is in terms of its having arisen. Arising is hence a ubiquitous charac- teristic of phenomena. This, of course, is part of what motivates treating it, as      as stasis and cessation, as inherently existent.
18. If this arising
Gave rise to that which is arising,
By means of what arising Does that arising arise?
If we take arisen things to require ontological grounds, then ground them not in other arisen things (since thai would gener- ale an obvious regress within the phenomenal world), but in dependent arising itself, there remains the infinite regress to which Niigiirjuna         earlier. Assuming dependent arising is to be the ground, then if grounds are needed, it too needs a ground. Niigiirjuna makes this explicit in the           verse: .
19. If another arising gives rise to this one, There would be an _infinite regress.
If something nonarisen is arisen,
Then all things couId arise in this way.
The last two lines of this verse emphasize thai the regress cannot ever be cut off by positing some nonarisen arising. Thai would, as Niigiirjuna argued above, patently beg the question.
20. Neither an existent nor a nonexistent Can be properly said to arise.
As it is taught before with
"For neither an existent nor a nonexistent."
The reference of the last line is to I: 6:
For neither an existent nor a nonexistent thing
Is a condition appropriate.
If a thing is nonexistent, how could it have a condition? If a thing is already existent, what       a condition do?
￼Examination ofthe Conditioned 171
The implicit argument is, then, that inherently existent phenomena cannot be said to arise since they would exist           and indepen- dently; nonexistent phenomena cannot be said to arise since if they did, they would exist. Arising can hence only be a property of noninherently, but                 existent phenomena. But it then         that arising as a property can only be a noninherently existent, conventional property.
Nagarjuna now tums his attention to the properties of cessa- tion and endurance. He begins, though, with a       remark on arising as a transition, concerning the          between arising and cessation. This next verse must be read along with VII: 23 and 26. Tugether they constitute an exhaustive discussion of the possible inherence of the three properties under discussion in ceasing entities:
21. The arising of a ceasing .thing Is not tenable.
But to say that it is not ceasing
Is not tenable for anything.
The first alternative Nagarjuna considers is that a ceasing thing is arising. But if a thing is already ceasing, it is therefore no longer arising. And since all phenomena are, when their impermanence is taken into consideration, ceasing, it would follow that nothing can be said to be arising.
22. A static existent does not endure.ss
A nonstatic existent does not endure.
Stasis does not endure. What nonarisen can endure?
55. To translate the Tibetan "gnas-pa," I have used "stasis (static)" as a noun form, "to endure" as a verb (and sometimes "to abide" to emphasize, where con- text makes it appropriate, the dynamie character of this process). One should bear in mind that these diverse English terms do not mark diverse Tibetan (or Sanskrit) terms in the original. I have tried to be consistent in preserving the connotations that are important in each context and to render the text in as Smooth English aS possible. This precludes the otherwise desirable lexical uniformity one would achieve by using one of these terms throughout.
￼172 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Niigarjuna now turns to stasis-the moment between ansmg and· ceasing. This verse must be read along with VII: 23, 25, and 27, which together provide a complete examination of the status of stasis. Herc he emphasizes that the moment between the arising and ceasing of a momentary phenomenon-an event- has no tempora! extent. So a thing that we might conventionally refer to as static literally does not endure with identity through time. But of course neither does something that is not even conventionally static. And finally, since as a consequence of· these two premises stasis is not instantiated in any phenomenon, it itself does not endure. So, Niigiirjuna concludes, stasis fails to exist over time in any sense and so is no candidate for an inher- ently existent phenomenon.
23. The endurance of a ceasing entity
Is no( tenable.
But to say that it is not ceasing
Is not tenable for anything.
This verse plays a central role in cach of two interwoven argu- ments. In the cóntext of VII: 21 and 26, it provides part of the exhaustive analysis of the impossibility of arising, abiding and ceas- ing as instantiated in ceasing (hence in impermanent) phenomena. In the context of VII: 22, 25, and 27, it provides part of the analysis of the impossibility of locating endurance in any phenomenon, hence emphasizing the impermanence of all phenomena. Since to exist is to exist in time and things that are ceasing are by definition not in a state of continued existence, ceasing phenomena do not provide the kind of continuity with numerical identity that endur- ance demands. And all phenomena are, upon analysis, seen to be constantly ceasing. So endurance has no possibility of instantia- tion, and ceasing phenomena cannot have this property as an essen- tial attribute.
24. lnasmuch as the nature of all things Is aging and death,
Without aging and death,
What existents can endure?
￼Examination ofthe Conditioned 173
Moreover, since all things decay, this analysis is          gen-       Nothing exists in the way that it would have to in order to have endurance as part of its essence.
25. Stasis cannot enduro through itself Or through another stasis.
Just as arising cannot arise from itself Or from another arising.
This verse recalls the discussion of VII: 13-19 and has an impor- tant echo in VII: 32. Niigiirjuna argued earlier thai we cannot analyze arising either as sui generis or as dependent upon some other arising. In the first case, we beg the question; in the second we invite an infinite regress. He now points out thai the same is true of stasis. We can't, in order to demonstrate the inherent existence of stasis, argue that it endures because of itself. If this kind of retlexive explanation were possible, we would not need to posit stasis in the first place as an explanation of the continued existence of empirical phenomena. Each could count as self- explanatory. ·But if we say that stasis, like other static things, is static because of its possessing a distinct stasis, we are off on a vicious regress.
26. The ceasing of what has ceased does not happen.
What has not yet ceased does not cease. Nor does that which is ceasing.
What nonarisen can cease?
Niigiirjuna thus completes the tripartite argument for the impos- sibility of the instantiation of arising, abiding, and ceasing begun in VII: 21 and 23. Cessation, conceived of as an inherently existent, independent property, needs a substratum. We have seen in the previous two verses in this argument that neither arising nor static things can provide this substratum. The only alternative remaining is the ceasing. But these phenomena, passing out of existence, are by definition not inherently existent and so fail as candidates. And again, since all phenomena are ceasing, this means that ceasing as an independent property has no basis. The argument here is an
￼174 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
obvious echo of the argument against the inherent existence of motion. So the conclusion to draw is not that there is no cessation or that there are no ceasing phenomena. That would be crazy. Rather, neither cessation nor any impermanent phenomenon can be identified independently as an entity itself. Their existence is purely relational. Niigiirjuna now turns to the cessation of the static:
27. The cessation of what is static Is not tenable.
Nor is the cessation of Something not static tenable.
1\vo points are being made here: First, if there were intrinsically real entities that could serve as ontological bases for cessation, they would have to have either remained stable or not. If the former, then in virtue of having the nature of stasis, they would be incapable of cessation. If the latler, since they never really existed, there is nothing to cease. But there is also a second point being made that depends upon the conventional reality of cessation. Since cessation is conventionally real and is incompatible both with inherently existent stasis and with there being no stasis at all, both of these alternatives with respect to stasis are eliminated. Cessa- tion and stasis must be understood relatively and not absolutely. This point is reiterated in the following verse:
28. Being static does not cease Through being static itself. Nor does being static cease
Through another instance of being static.
This verse also echoes VII: 25 and !hat discussion of the impossi- bility of arising being either self-explanatory or always explained by reference to yet another arising. All things, having remained momentarily in existence, change constantly. This, however, can- not be explained by reference to the nature of stasis, either reflex- ively or regressively.
￼Examinatlon ofthe Conditloned 175
29. When the arising of any entity
Is not tenable,
Then the cessation of any entity Is not tenable.
Since nothing arises inherently, nothing ceases inherently. Since upon careful examination nothing withstands analysis as an inher- ently existing phenomenon, nothing remains independent of con- ventional designation to be characterized as arising or ceasing. This is how it goes from the ultimate standpoint. From thai standpoint-though achieved by noting the universality of arising and cessation of conventional phenomena-since there are no phe- nomena, there is no arising and cessation. But by contraposition we get the corelativity and mutual entailment of arising and ceas- ing at the conventional level.
30. For an existent thing
Cessation is not tenable.
A single thing being an entity and
A nonentity is not tenable.
This verse and the next reinforce the point about the ultimate nonexistence of cessation and, by implication, of arising and stasis. In the preceding, Niigiirjuna emphasizes that for an inherently existent entity to cease to exist would be for it to inherently exist and not exist. In the subsequent verse, he points out that it makes no sense for a nonexistent thing to cease to be, just as it makes no sense to behead someone a second time:
31. Moreover, for a nonentity,
Cessation would be untenable.
Just as a second beheading Cannot be          
32. Cessation does not cease by means of itself. Nor does it cease by means of another.
Just as arising cannot arise from itself
Or from another arising.
￼176 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
This verse has an exact parallel in VII: 25. Again, Niigiirjuna         the uncomfortable choice between a           begged ques- tion and a vicious regress presented originally in the context of the discussion of arising and recalled in the discussion of stasis. The argument applies, mutatis mutandis, to cessation. The conclusion of this trio of arguments is thai we cannot conceive of any of the three characteristics of dependent arising as self-grounded. All must be understood dependently and hence as empty.
33. Since arising, ceasing, and abiding
Are not estabtished, there are no compounded things.
lf all compounded things are unestablished, How could the uncompounded be established?
That is, arising, abiding, and ceasing are not entities at          are mere relations. Since these fundamental attributes of depen- dently arisen phenomena are empty of inherent existence, what could have inherent existence?
34. Like a dream, like an illusion,
Like a city of Gandharvas, So have arising, abiding, And ceasing been explained.
This chapter thus brings the first principal section of Millamad- hyamakakiirikii to a close, drawing together the threads spun in the earlier chapters to produce a thorough demonstration of the emptiness of the conventional phenomenal world. Having demon- strated the emptiness of conditions and their relations to their effects, change and impermanence, the elements, the aggregates,56 and characteristics and their bases-in short, of all the fundamen- tal Buddhist categories of analysis and explanation-Niigiirjuna has now considered the totality they determine-dependent aris- ing itself and the entire dependently arisen phenomenal world-
56. Sometimes translated as "heaps,„ or "collections." These are the groups of more basie phenomena into which complex phenomena such as persons are decom· posed in analysis. The decomposition is in principle bottomless-bundJes of bun· dJes of bundles. , .. See Chapters III and IV.
￼Examination ofthe Conditioned 177
arguing that dependent arising and what is dependently arisen are themselves empty of inherent existence.
This is a deep result. lt again presages the doctrine of the empti- ness of emptiness that is made explicit in Chapter XXIV, and it develops further the theme explored in Chapter I, namely, that when from the Miidhyamika perspective one asserts that a thing is empty or that it is dependently arisen, one is not contrasting their status with the status of some other things that are inherently existent. Nor is one asserting that they are merely dependent on some more fundamental independent thing. Nor is one asserting that instead of having an independent essence things have as their essence dependence or emptiness, either or both of which exist in some other way. Rather, as far as one analyzes, one finds only dependence, relativity, and emptiness, and their dependence, rela- tivity, and emptiness.
But this is not to say either that emptiness, dependent arising or conventional phenomena are nonexistent-that they are hallucina- tions. Indeed it is to say the opposite. For the upshot of this critical analysis is that existence itself must be reconceived. What is said to be "like a dream, like an illusion" is their existence in the mode in which they are ordinarily perceived/conceived-as inherently exis- tent. Inherent existence simply is an incoherent notion.57 The only sense that "existence" can be given is a conventional, relative sense. And in demonstrating that phenomena have exactly that kind of existence and that dependent arising has exactly that kind of existence, we recover the existence of phenomenal reality in the context of emptiness. In the next major section, comprising Chap- ters VIII through XIII, Niigiirjuna addresses the emptiness of the subject of experience.
57. Compare Wood (1994), who misses the structure of this simile. The respect in which dependently arisen things are like a dream is this: Thef exist in one way (as empty) and appear to exist in another (as inherently existent). Just as dreams and mirages exist in one way (as iUusions) and appear to exist in another (as objects of perception, or as water). But dreams and mirages are real dreams and mirages. So this verse should not be interpreted as asserting the complete nonexistence of all phenomena..
￼Chapter VIII
Examination of the Agent and Action
The discussion of external phenomena comprised by the first seven chapters of the text leads naturally to a discussion of the subject side of experience, a discussion that occupies the next six chapters. For it might be granted that the phenomenal extemal world is empty, but argued thai it depends for its nominat existence on an inherently existing subject. This idealist tactic, familiar in the West through Berkeley and Hume (and criticized by Kant in the refuta- tion of idealism), was adopted by some (the Cittamiitra school) in the bistory of Buddhist philosophy. We can well imagine an oppo- nent at this stage in the dialectic conceding to Niigiirjuna that external phenomena lack inherent existence and that the depen- dent arising thai characterizes them lacks inherent existence, but thai their very emptiness entails their nominat character and, hence, some subject capable of engaging in nominat imputation. So the subject as agent must exist.
1. This existent agent
Does not perform an existent action. Nor does some nonexistent agent        some nonexistent action.
￼Examination of     Agent and Action 179
Niigiirjuna here announces that, with respect to agency and ac- tion as well, he will steer a middle course between inherent exis- tence and complete nonexistence. Neither action nor agent will come out to be an inherently existing entity. Nor will either end up being completely nonexistent.
2. An existent entity has no activity.
There would also be action without an agent. An existent.entity has no activity.
There would also be agent without action.
Jf the agent were inherently existent, then it would be unchang- ing. Activity is always a kind of change. So if there were action in the context of an inherently existing agent, the action would be agentless, which would be absurd. Moreover, the agent would be inactive, which would also be absurd. This, of course, is just one more case of Niigarjuna demonstrating the incoherence of a posi- tion that tries both to posil inherently existent, independent en- tities and then to get them to interact.
3. If a nonexistent agent
Were to perform a nonexistent action, Then the action would be without a cause And the agent would be without a cause.
However, if agent and action are totally nonexistent, there will be no cause for the action and no justification for calling the agent an agent.
4. Without a cause, the effect and
lts cause will not occur.
Without this, activity and
Agent and action are not possible.
Agent, the agent's activity, and the action all depend upon condi- tions. They are all, therefore, dependently arisen and empty. Jf, as the opponent would have it, these are inherently existent, there would be no action. But if we think of them as dependent, we can make per- fectly good sense of agent, activity and action in interrelation.
￼180 THE TEXT AND           
S. If activity, etc., are not possible,
Entities and nonentities are not possible.
lf there are neither entities nor nonentities, Effects cannot      from them.
lf there were no action, then since entities arise from the action of previous events, there would be no entities and no effects. In short, without making sense of the possibility of actions and agency as empty, we can't account for the existence of any phenomena.
6. lf there are no effects, liberation and Paths to higher realms will not exist. So all of activity
Would be without purpose.
And all of this has a       and a soteriological dimension as well. For if there are no acts and no effects, then the practice of morality and of the Buddhist path will make no sense. There would be no point to life if human action is impossible. And again, its impossibility follows straightforwardly from the reification of ei- ther agent or action. lt is ironie that it is the urge to guarantee more reality and significance for ourselves than emptiness appears to allow that leads to a view of life as perfectly impossible and pointless. That is, though we are led to ascribe inherent, indepen- dent existence to ourselves and to the world of phenomena we cherish-in part, in order to assign them the greatest possible importance-this very importance would be completely under- mined by such inherent existence and independence. For in that case, all activity and all consequences of activity would be impossi- ble. The resultant life would be static, detached, and utterly mean- ingless. Only in the context of emptiness-what might appear to be the greatest threat to meaningfulness-can a meaningful life be understood.
7. An existent and             agent
Does not        an existent and nonexistent action. Existence and nonexistence cannot pertain to the same thing. For how could they exist together?
￼Examination of the Agent and Action 181
There is no way to escape from this dilemma by trying to have it both ways: The agent cannot be existent as an actor, but nonexis- tent as one who undergoes the action. Nor can the action be exis- tent as an entity, but nonexistent as dependent upon the agent.
8. An actual agent
Does not perform a nonactual action.
Nor by a nonactual one is an actual one performed. From this, all of those errors wouId follow.
Nor is it coherent to suppose thai the agent is existent, but the action nonexistent. For then there       be no reason to call the agent an agent. An agent, after all, is someone who          an action. The next two verses put this point and those made in the opening verses together:
9. An existent agent
Does not perform an action that
Is unreal or both real and unreal
As we have already agreed. ·
10. A nonexistent agent
Does not perform an action that
Is unreal or both real and unreal
As we have already agreed.
11. An existent and nonexistent agent
does not perform an action that Is unreal or both real and unreal As we have agreed.
Niigarjuna now moves to assert his positive position on this mat- ter: Agent and action are interdependent. Neither is           or               prior to or independent of the other. What it is to be an agent is to be           an action. What it is to be an action is to be the action of an agent:
12. Action depends upon the agent. The agent itself depends on action.
One cannot see any way
To establish them differently.
￼182 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
13. From this elimination of agent and action,
One should elμcidate appropriation in the same way. Through action and agent
All rep&gt;aining things should be understood.
By "appropriation," Niigiirjuna indicates any cognitive act by means of which one takes an attribute or entity as one's own, or as part of one's self. That includes the grasping of the aggregates as the self or of one's mental states as part of one's identity or of one's possessions as central to one's being. Appropriation in this broad sense is, hence, a central object of concern for Buddhist philoso- phy and psychology, and the relation between the appropriator and the act of appropriation is an important object of analysis. For in many ways the self that is constructed through appropriation presents itself as the subject of appropriation. But it is merely constructed, and its substantial reality is illusory. Then what in- deed does the appropriation? And where there is no appropriator, how does appropriation occur? Niigiirjuna here suggests that this account of the relation between agent and action provides a model for understanding that relation. That is, this analysis provides a        paradigm for understanding the nature of subjectivity. In all cases of the relation between an agent of any kind and an act of any kind, the identity of the two will be seen to be mutually depen- dent, and each will come out as conventionally real, though not as inherently existent. We will see this paradigm articulated over the next live chapters as Niigiirjuna argues that we cannot make any sense of the self as an entity independent of its actions, percep- tions, and interactions. Nor can we make any sense of the ontology of these phenomena as independent of the subject. This is a natu- ra! extension of the analysis of emptiness of the external world and demonstrates Nagiirjuna's determination to treat all phenomena on the same basis.
￼Chapter IX Examination of the Prior Entity
Now one can        imagine an opponent responding to the argu- ment of the previous chapter by granting that agency and its corelative phenomena might be empty, yet       denying that aware- ness itself-the subjectivity that grounds                  be empty. For, one might argue, the emptiness of all phenomena       requires that there be a subject for whom they are phenomena. Niigiirjuna             this response in the opening verses of this chapter:
I. Since sight and hearing, etc., and Feeling, etc., exist,
He who has and uses them
Must exist prior to those, some say.
2. If there were no existent thing, How could seeiog, etc., arise'!
It         from this that prior to this, there is an existent thing.
That is, without a subject of experience, there can be no experi- ence and no experienced objects. This argument has          in- stances in Descartes and Kant. But Niigiirjuna, siding with Hume on this issue, begins by asking how this entity       be an object of           
￼184 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
3. How is an entity existing prior to Seeing, hearing, etc., and
The felt, etc., Jtself known?
So first, Niigiirjuna points out, we have no direct evidence for the existence of such an entity because evidence of it would require that it could be an object, but is supposed by its proponent to be . purely subjective. Moreover, Niigiirjuna points out, it is supposed to be independent of and ontologically prior to perception and the perceived. So:
4. l f it can abide
Without the scen, etc.,
Then, without a doubt, They can abide without it.
That is, independence is a two-way street. If the self is indepen- dent of its perceiving and perception, then its perceiving and per- ception are independent of it. Now there is one reading of this claim on which it is straightforwardly and foolishly fallacious. Niigiirjuna is not arguing that all relations are symmetric. lt does not follow from the fact that this book is on your table that your table is on the book, and Niigiirjuna is not foolish enough to think that it does. The point is, rather, once again the Humean one that whatever is indeed logically independent is separable. The oppo- nent wants to argue that the self is logically independent of its perceptions and their contents. But if so, then they are separable, and we can imagine not only a nonperceiving subject, but also unperceived perceptions. Just as we can imagine a elear table and a book not on a table. But, Niigiirjuna suggests, the idea of unper- ceived perceptions is both absurd on its face and contradictory to the opponent's theoretical framework.
5. Someone is disclosed by something. Something is disclosed by someone.ss
58. The Sanskrit strong]y suggests that the "someone" is to be understood as the appropriator (in the sense discussed in the previous chapter) and that the "some- thing" is to be understood as· the appropriated object. Later commentators (e.g.,
￼Examination ofthe Prior Entity 185 Without something how can someone exist?
Without someone how can something exist?
Nagiirjuna here emphasizes the corelativity and interdepen- dence of subject and object.59 Subjectivity only emerges when there is an object of awareness. Pure subjectivity is a contradiction in adjecto. Moreover, the idea of an object with no subject is contradictory. The very concept of being an object is thai of being the object of a subject. The affinities to Kant and Schopenhauer here are quite strong, but should not be pushed too far. Nagiirjuna would clearly have no truck with the substantialist flavor of their analysis of the subject and object.
6. White prior to all of seeing, etc.,
That prior entity doesn't exist, Through seeing, etc., by another one, That other one becomes disclosed.
An opponent might at this point argue thai although there is no continuous prior eolity thai endures through time and stands be- hind all perception, we musi posit an eolity as the basis of each individual perceptual episode. The self on this model would be a succession of momentary but inherently existent subjects of mo- ments of experience. But, Niigarjuna argues in the next verse, the same argument against positing a single prior eolity can be mobi- lized against each punctal prior eolity:
7. If prior to all of seeing, etc., No prior entity exists,
Candrakirti and Tsong Khapa see esp. pp. 210-11) generally treat the verse this way. This would be a reminder that perception is a special case of appropriation. (I thank the Ven. Gareth Sparham for pointing this out.)
59. But not their identity. Though subject and object as well as interna) and external objects are, for Nigiirjuna, all ultimately empty and, in important senses, · interdependent, they are not identical. Physical objects are, as Kant would empha- size,             external to the mind in a way that pains are not; and the conven- tional perceiver is not one with the perceived. When I see an elephant, it is not,
thereby, the case that I have a trunk!
￼186 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY How could an entity prior
To each seeing exist?
That is, given thai there is no need to identify an independent self as the basis of all seeing, there is no need to establish one as a basis for each one independently. The same arguments for the relativity and relational character oi perception apply, mutatis mutandis, for each perceptual episode. Moreover, even if we did posil such entities, they would get us nowhere toward positing the self that the reifier of self really cares about-a continuous self with which we can really identity and whose fale we can care about.
8. I f the seer itself is the hearer itself,
And the feeler itself, at different limes, Prior to each of these he would have to arise. But this makes no sense.
Moreover, since this proposal is for a distinct prior entity for each perceptual episode, we would need distinct subjects for, for example, hearing and seeing. But as we can do these things at the same time, it would follow thai there are multiple simultaneous selves. The unity of experience thai is the putative explanandum and motivation for positing this entity in the first place (empha- sized in the first two lines) would dissolve. Niigiirjuna emphasizes this conclusion at IX: 9:
9. l f the seer itseli is distinct,
The hearer is distinct and the feeler is distinct,
Then when there is a seer there would also be a hearer, And there would have to be many selves.
10. Seeing and         etc., And feeling, etc.,
And that from which these are arisen:
There is no existent there.
However, one should not be tempted to try to ground percep- tion, the perceived object, and the perceiver in some more funda-
￼Examination ofthe Prior Entity 187
mental ontological ground-some intrinsically identical basis for their existence. For the need to develop a substantial foundation for these phenomena should vanish once one sees thai not only do they have no ultimate ontic status, but thai they need none. They, like all phenomena, emerge relationally and dependently.
11. Seeing and hearing, etc„ And feeling, etc.,
If thai to which they belong does not exist,
They themselves do not exist.
Not only has this analysis refuted the inherent existence of the self as a basis for experience, but in virtue of so doing, it has refuted the inherent existence of perception and the perceptual faculties.
12. For whomever prior to,
Simultaneous with, or after seeing, etc., there is nothing, For sucha one, assertions like "it exists" or "it does not
exist"-
Such conceptions will cease.
Niigiirjuna here generalizes the point and offers a diagnosis of the confusion he has worked to resolve: Just as we want to say thai the self as pure subject does not exist-nor do perception or per- ceptual objects exist as entities-yet want to affirm the conven- tional reality of perception, perceivers, and perceiveds, in          we want to deny the inherent existence of phenomena and affirm their conventional reality. Just as we want to say thai the self neither exists inherently nor that it is nonexistent inherently, we want to refrain from attributing inherent existence or inherent nonexistence to all entities. The apparent paradox involved in say- ing thai things both exist and do not exist in one breath and saying that they neither exist nor do not exist in another-indeed of refusing in another sense to permit even these predications in an- other mood-arises, Niigiirjuna points out, from the conceptual imputation of inherently existent bases for these predications, which then have to be thought of as having contradictory proper-
￼188 THE TEXT &lt;\ND COMMENTARY
ties. Absent the bases, we can see these assertions merely as useful analytical tools in various dialectical contexts to help us to see the ultimately empty and conventionally real nature of phenomena, And Nagarjuna concludes this chapter by asserting that once one ceases hypostasizing the subjective self-that entity that might seem to be, as Descartes notes, the most obviously existent and most easily known entity of all-the temptation to hypostasize other entities dissolves.

This chapter, the      one in this set of chapters            address- ing an external phenomenon, is in fact concerned          with a standard                to the kind of arguments Nagarjuna of- fered in the two previous chapters on subjectivity in action and in perception.        that in those discussions Nagarjuna argues that subject and object cannot be              and distinctly identified as entities because of their        dependence. Buddhist         asserting             identity in the context of dependent co-             such as            and Sautrantika          used the example of fire aild fuel to demonstrate the                of sub-          independent identity and dependent             as      as the             of the one-way dependence          that these         assert thai actions and perception bear to the self. Just as fire depends on      but not vice versa, they       argue, and just as fire and      have distinct identities despite the fact that the former depends for its existence on the         action and percep- tion can depend on the subject but not vice versa. Despite this dependence, proponents of this view       argue each         can be                          as an entity.60 In this chapter, Nagarjuna undertakes the task of demonstrating that the example does not demonstrate these                ·

!. If fuel were fire
Then agent and action would be one. If fire were different from fuel,
Then it could      without fueJ.61
The opponent does not want to assert the identity of fire and fuel, first, since it would contradict common sense, but second, since that, by the intended analogy, would identify agent and ac- tion, self and perception. On the other hand, if they are identified as intrinsically different-as having distinct and independent essen- tial identities-they should be able to arise independently. Fuel should count as fuel even if there were no fire; fire should be possible without fuel. This follows from drawing the distinction at the level of intrinsic identity. Of course, distinguishing them con- ventionally permits their mutual dependence, but fails to establish the intrinsic identity intended by the reificationist.
2. It would be forever aftame;
Flames could be ignited without a cause.
Its beginning would be meaningless.
In that case, it would be without any action.
The second and third verses spell out the consequences of attrib- uting inherent existence to fire: lt would be independent of all conditions, including its fuel; it would bum causelessly, since there would be no condition under which it would not bum. So all fire would, in that case, be etemal. Moreover, it would not consume anything, having no connection to the presence or absence of fuel. Moreover, Niigiirjuna asserts in the       two lines of X: 3, the activity of starting a fire would be nonsensical:
3. Since it would not depend on another Ignition would be without a cause.
If it were etemally in flames, Starting it would be meaningless.
61. The intended sense of "fuel" herc is          that is actually buming-not. for instance, firewood neatly stacked outside.
￼Examination ofFire and Fuel 191
4. So, if one thinks thai
That which is buming is the fuel, If it is just this,
How is this fuel being burned?
Nagarjuna now sets up a destructive dilemma: Either the process of burning is identical to the fuel or different. In X: 4, he considers 'the possibility that they are identical. Ifso, he suggests, we have a problem in explaining how the fuel is consumed. The ordinary expla- nation of thai is the presence of fire. But by identifying the burning process with the fuel, we have left the fire out of the picture. This analysis hence provides no explanation of combustion. After all, fuel by itself does not bum. lt musi be ignited, that is, fire musi be introduced. If, as Nagarjuna argues in X: 5, they are completely different, there won't beany fire at all. For then the burning would be dissociated from and independent of the fuel, and the unburned fuel would not be consumed by the burning. We could make no
sense of the transition from unburned to burned fuel. The         mora! is that we cannot make sense of interactive processes such as combustion without attending to the mutual dependence of the interacting phenomena thai constitute those processes:
5. If they are different, and if one not yet connected isn't connected,
The not yet burned will not be burned.
They will not cease. I f they do not cease Then it will persist with its own characteristic.
6. Just as a man and a woman
Connect to one another as man and woman,
So if fire were different from fuel,
Fire and fuel would have to be fit for connection.
Here the opponent suggests that just as males and females are suited to connect in special ways in virtue of their particular ana- tomical structures, despite existing independently of one another, fire and fuel may be similarly suited to some special'kind of connec- tion. In that case, we would have the bizarre picture of fire being independent of fuel, yet peculiarly suited to coming together with
￼192 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
it, and vice versa.62 Moreover, since on this model fire and fuel are distinct from one another in nature, yet interactive (they "pre- clude" each other in the sense that causes and effects preclude one another-that is, in virtue of being connected yet incapable of
·simultaneous copresence), there must stili be some account of how they connect, an account by no means easy to envisage:
7. And, iffire and fuel Preclude each other
Then fire being different from fuel,
It must still be asserted thai they connect.
Fire and fuel hence appear to be mutually dependent. Indeed the central point of Niigiirjuna's argument is that they are. But here the question arises: Don't they then have either to depend upon some third more fundamental thing or to be asymmetrically dependent, one of them established independently of the other?
8. If fire depends on fuel, And fuel depends on fire,
On what are fire and fuel established as dependent? Which one is established first?
If either is established as an entity first, without any reliance on the existence or nature of the other, that member of the pair would have a claim to being the basis in an asymmetrical dependency relation, and the opponent would have the counterexample neces- sary to refute the analysis in Chapters VIII and IX. The most obvious form that such an asymmetric dependence could take would involve the dependence of fire on. fuel. Niigiirjuna argues that this is impossible to maintain:
9. If fire depends on fuel,
It would be the establishment of an established fire. And the fuel could be fuel
Without any fire.
62. See also Kalupahana (1986), p. 199.
￼Examination of Fire and Fuel 193
There are two arguments here. In the first two lines, Niigiirjuna argues that if fire were to depend upon fuel, fire would be doubly established. The point is that in order for the fuel to count as fuel, the existence of the fire musi have already been established; in- deed, the fuel depends upon the fire for its character as fuel. So to say then that the fire is dependent upon the fuel would be to argue that something whose existence is already presupposed if the fuel is to exist depends for its existence on that fuel. Note that this is only problematic for the opponent. That is, for one who accepts, as Niigiirjuna does, the mutual interdependence of phenomena, it is in fact true that fire depends upon fuel and thai fuel depends upon fire. But the opponent at this stage in the argument argues that fire exists only dependently, but dependently on independent fuel. So Niigiirjuna only needs to show that position to be untenable. And the problem for the opponent is simply that the fuel he wants to exist independently can only do so in the presence of fire, which itself is merely dependent.
Second, Niigiirjuna argues, this would entail the absurd indepen- dent establishment of fuel as fuel. For fuel to be established inde- pendently as fuel in the absence of fire would be for there to be some characteristic of fuel that could be specified independently of fire that makes it fuel. But there is none. What makes fuel fuel is that it is combustible.
10. I f thai on which an entity depends Is established on the basis
Of the entity depending on it,
What is established in dependence on what?
So in order to establish the existence of fuel as fuel, we must establish the existence of fire. In order for something to be fire, it must be consuming fuel. Neither depends asymmetrically on the other.
11. What entity is established through dependence?
If it is not established, then how could it depend? However, if it is established merely through dependence, That dependence makes no sense.
￼194 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Now Nagarjuna draws the         ontological       from this discussion of the putative counterexample. If an entity is inher- ently existent, it musi be independently established as an entity and with its own nature. So no entity could be established as inher- ently existent through dependence on any other entity. Only inher- ently existent entities could be independent. To establish some- thing as inherently existent through its dependence on something else is incoherent. So since entities can be established neither through independence nor through dependence, there is no way to establish anything as an entity in its own right.
12. Fire is not dependent upon fuel.
Fire is not independent of fuel. Fuel is not dependent upon fire. Fuel is not independent of fire.
That is, neither fuel nor fire can be established as independent bases of predication separate from one another that then stand in accidental relations to one another. There are not two entities, fire and fuel, which then are related either by dependence or interdependence.
13. Fire does not coine from something else, Nor is fi.re in fuel itself.
Moreover, fi.re and the rest are just Hke
The moved, the not-moved, and the goer.
Though, as verse 12 grants, fire exists only in relation to fuel, it would not be correct to assert that fuel as an independent entity somehow produces fire. The analysis and the conclusion are strictly analogous to that regarding motion and the mover. We neither can say that motion is the same as the mover nor that they are different entities. We cannot say that motion is present in the unmoved, the moving, or the yet-to-move. Similarly we cannot say that fire is the same as the fuel nor thai it is different. Nor can we say thai it is present in the unburned, the burning, or the yet-to-be- burned fuel. The next verse emphasizes this point:
￼14.
15.
Fuel is not fire.
Fire does not arise from anything different from fuel. Fire does not possess fuel.
Fuel is not in fire, nor vice versa.
Through discussion of fire and fuel,
The self and the aggregates, the pot and cloth All together,
Without remainder have been explained.
Examination o f Fire and Fue/ 195
The fire and fuel example is used as an analogy for a number of different cases of relations between bases and their attributes, in-         the relation between the putative self and its aggregates- that is, the components of the personality. But there are other stock examples-the relation between the pot and its properties and between the       and its thread-that are used to try to defend these asymmetrical dependence relations between inher- ently existent bases and the properties they support. Nagarjuna is simply asserting the complete generality of this argument: lt ap- plies, mutatis mutandis, to all of these cases.
16. I do not think that
Those who teach that the self
Is the same as or different from the entities
Understand the meaning of the doctrine.
This colophon verse reminds us thai when existence is under- stood in terms of emptiness and when entities are regarded as purely relational in character, identity and difference can only be understood conventionally. This applies not only with respect to apparently distinct entities, but also to the relation between parts and wholes, things and their attributes, events and their causes, and as Nagarjuna emphasizes here, self and the objects of aware- ness. Strict identity and difference as determined by reference to phenomena themselves are only conceivable from the incoherent standpoint of inherent existence.

￼Chapter XI Examination of the Initial and
      Limits
But suppose that one could see thai the self, considered as agent or as subject, lacks inherent existence, and stili one argued that none- theless it must do so in virtue of its impermanence and being subject to change. Then, one might argue, birth, aging, and death musi be real as the conditions of the self's unreality. This is the position with which Niigiirjuna concerns himself in this chapter. But he is also concerned with the generalization of this question to the birth, ag- ing, and death of all of cyclic existence.63 And it is this more general problem with which he actually opens the chapter, developing the account of individual impermanence as a special case:"
63. In Buddhist philosophy, the entire phenomenal world is referred to as cyclic existence ( 'khor-ba; Skt: sarrrsdra). This term indicates not only the endless cycle of birth and death posited by the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth, but also the universally cyclic character of phenomena: Perception and action form a cycle; motivation and action form a cycle; the seasons are cyclic; chains of interdependence of phenomena arc cyclic; interpersonal relations arc cyclic; craving and acquisition arc cyclic. It is this metaphor, suggesting that all of unenlightcned existence amounts to going around in circles despite the illusion of progress, that most poignantly captures the sense in which all of human existence is suffering. See Sogyal Rinpoche 1992, pp. 18-22, fot an excellent discussion.

I. When asked about the beginning,
The Great Sage said that nothing is known of it.65 Cyclic existence is without end and beginning.
So there is no beginning or end.
The question about the existence and nature of the origin of the world is one of the questions thai Sakyamuni Buddha declared to be unanswerable. Niigiirjuna here interprets that to mean thai there is nothing coherent thai can be said about the origin of the world. Given the striking similarity between the questions that the Buddha declared unanswerable and those that Kant argues to be unanswer- able by reason in the Antinomies of Pure Reason, there is much to be said for this diagnosis.66 So Niigiirjuna here claims that we cannot
a discussion of the problem of the beginning of personal existence and as an argument to the effect that cyclic existence and the predicament of suffering is beginningless, or at least that it is pointless or impossible to discuss and ponder its beginning. On the other hand, given the parallels between the analysis herc and that in Chapter XXVII, where ihe questions conceming the finitude or infinitude of personal existence and of the world's existence arc explicitly juxtaposed and receive identical treatment, there is good reason to see this chapter as implicitly addressing both as well.

There are three popular readings of the Buddha's refusal to answer the "unanswer- able questions." On one reading this was an example of his great skili in teaching; any answer he would have given would have been misconstrued and would have had adverse consequences for the student. On another reading, by refusing to answer, the Buddha was indicating that asking these questions does not conduce to successful practice of the Buddhist path and that one should focus one's mind on more soteriologically efficacious issues. On a third reading-the one adopted here-these questions are in fact metaphysically misguided. They all involve incoherent essen- tialist presuppositions that, when rejected, render the questions meaningless.

The Buddha pronounced unanswerable questions regarding whether the world has an origin or an end in time or space, whether the individual continues to exist after entering nirvaua, whether there is some entity that transmigrates, and whether thete is tempora! beginning or end to the continuum of consciousness.

make sense of the beginning or end of all of cyclic existence- beginnings and ends are beginnings and ends of actual, convention- ally designated and delimited processes within cyclic existence.
2. Where there is no beginning or enó, How could there be a middle?
It follows thai thinking about this in terms of
Prior, posterior, and simultaneous is not appropriate.
The concept of a middle, Niigiirjuna argues, is bound up with those of beginnings and ends. We can say that we and all phenotn- ena are within cyclic existence, but to posit determinate absolute spatiotemporal locations is senseless.
3. lf birth carne first,
And then old age and death,
pronounces unanswerable questions regarding the substantiality, simplicity, personal identity, and primacy of the self, as well as questions regarding the finiteness or infinitude of the world in space and time, the ultimate divisibility of the world, the freedom of the will, and the existence of God. Murti (1985) makes a bit too much of this parallel, however, arguing that Nagarjuna follows Kant in asserting that
the aim in cosmological speculation (Rational Cosmology) is to reach the uncon- ditioned ground of empirical objects by means of a regressive claim of reasoning (i.e. arguing from effect to cause) stretched illegitimately, as Kant points out, beyond the possibility of experience . . . .
The question regarding the Tathdgata is in fact about the ultimate ground of both the soul and objects-about the unconditioned in          The Tathagata as the Perfect Man is the ultimate essence of the universe. His position is analogous to that of God of Rational Theology..
The forrnulation of the problems in the thesis-antithesis form is itself evi· dence of the conflict in Reason, that the conflict is not on the empirical level and so not capable of being settled by appeal to facts is realized by the Buddha when he declares them unsoluble . . . "(pp. xiii-xv).
While N3g3rjuna shares with Kant a critical approach to philosophy-each seeks to limo the bounds of thought-and while Kant posits an unconditioned realm that is the unknowable but necessary ground of the empirical world, N3gftrjuna eschews just sucha ground. His treatment of the unanswerable questions, then, differs from Kant's, despite the many genuine paraUels, in that while for Kant the antinomies represent the application of concepts beyond their range, for Nagarjuna they repre· sent sheer nonsense: These antinomies are not for him insoluble problems. but rather pairs of apparently coherent but in fact nonsensical verba! formulations.
￼Examination o f the Initia/ and Fina/ Limits 199 Then birth would be ageless and deathless,
And a deathless one would be bom.
Birth, old age, and death here are to be understood in an. abso- lute sense. Of course, conventionally, the birth of a particular human being comes before her/his aging, which precedes her/his death. But that should not lead us to think of that birth as the origin of an entity, that aging as the midpoint ih the life of that entity, or that death as the end of that entity. If one adopts a doctrine of rebirth, as does Nagarjuna and as do all of his interlocu- tors, the point can be made quite straightforwardly: For any sen- tient continuum, every birth is preceded by an aging and a death, and so forth.
But even setting aside the particular doctrine of rebirth, we can elucidate. this insight with equal force: To see particular entities as having determinate, nonconventional beginnings of existence and determinate, nonconventional termini and, hence, that there are distinct limes at which there is a elear fact of the matter about whether or not they exist, independent of conventions for their individuation, is to see those entities as having necessary and suffi- cient characteristics for their identity, that is, as having essences. But the central thesis Nagiirjuna is defending is thai this very con- ception of what it is to exist is incoherent-that things are empty of such essences and that the boundaries of objects are conventional and indeterminate: There is no fixed boundary between the exis- tence of a seed, the tree to which it gives rise, a piece of wood from that tree, and a table fashioned therefrom or between the existence of an intact table, a broken table, wooden table parts, ashes, earth, · the nutrients for a seed, that seed, the sapling to which it gives rise, and another tree.
Once we see the world from the standpoint of emptiness of inherent existence, the bistory of any conventionally designated entity is but an arbitrary stage carved out of a vast continuum of interdependent phenomena.67 The arising of any phenomenon, hu-
67. One must not, however, take this to mean that for Nagarjuna there is an inherently existent continuum out of which we carve the merely conventional. Rather just as any totality is dependent upon its parts, the totality of empirical
￼200 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
man, nonhuman sentient being, or inanimate object is the conse- quence of the .disintegration of others. That disintegration suc- ceeds their arising and aging. Once we give up the intrinsic identity of entities, the constant cycle of death, birth, aging, and rebirth of entities is unavoidable.
4. Ifbirth were to come 8.fter, And old age and death first,
How could there be a causeless aging and death
Of one not born?
But birth has to precede death as well, on pain of the absurdity of something that is unborn dying. And, as Niigiirjuna points out in the next verse, we must think conventionally of these things in sequence because any conventionally designated object undergoes them in order:
5.
6.
Birth and age and death
Cannot occur_ at one time.
Theo what is being barn would be .dying
And both would occur without cause.
When the series of the prior. simultaneous, and posterior
Is not possible,
Why are you led to posit This birth, aging, and death?
The birth, aging, and death that the opponent has in mind can be represented at two levels: At the most         level, it is the birth, aging, and· death of cyclic existence, the examination of which frames this discussion. At thai level, Niigiirjuna is pointing out that
reality depends upon its empty components and, so. is itself empty. Ontology presupposes conventional categories. Nor is this to say that the conventions we adopt arc from our perspective arbitrary. They reftect our needs, our biological, psychological, perceptual, and social characteristics, as well as our languages and customs. Given these constraints and conventions, there are indeed facts of the matter regarding empirical claims and regarding the meanings of words. But there is no transcendent standpoint, Nagarjuna would insist, from which these conven- tions and constraints can be scen as justitied.
￼Examination o f the lnitial and Fina/ Limits 201
these conceptions, having legitimate employment only within the empirical realm, are nonsense. But the opponent could also be interpreted as positing birth, aging, and death as determinate, intrin- sically identifiable moments in the evolution of empirical phenom- ena or, specifically, of sentient beings. Niigiirjuna rejects that as well, arguing thai moments intrinsically prior to, simultaneous with, or posterior to the existence of entities cannot be identified, given the lack of intrinsic identity of the entities themselves. So long as one in conceiving of phenomena thinks of them as temporally deter- minate and bounded, and thinks of the identity of things as intrinsic to them, one will have to identify their beginnings, middles, and ends. But this leads to paradox, given the indeterminateness, inter- dependence, and interpenetration of things. Nagiirjuna hence ad- vises the rejection of this ontology:
7. Not      is cyclic existence itself without beginning, No existent has a beginning:
Neither cause and effect;
N9r character and characterized . . .
The alternative, both with respect to cyclic existence as a whole and with respect to individual entities, is to reject the ontology of entities and characteristics altogether, along with the boundaries and determinate relations thai ontology requires:
8. Nor feeling and the feeler; Whatever there is;
All entities
Are without beginning.
￼ChapterXII Examination of Suffering
The first of the Four Noble Truths is that "all this is suffering." So one can imagine an interlocutor granting all that has gone before, but in defense of Buddhist orthodoxy, insisting that suffering is inherently existent. After all, the Four Noble Truths are, from a Buddhist perspective, truths. Nagiirjuna, of course, is a Buddhist and accepts the Four Noble Truths. (In fact, the principal chapter of this work, Chapter XXIV, is devoted to an exposition of the Four Noble Truths from the standpoint of emptiness and to the argument that only on Nagiirjuna's analysis can these truths be maintained at all.) So he must, without denying the reality of suffering, explain its emptiness.
!. Some say suffering is self-produced,
Or produced from another or from both. Or that it arises without a cause.
It is not the kind of thing to be produced.
These are the four possibilities with regard to inherently existent suffering. The echo of I: I is obvious, and the argument here will depend heavily upon the analysis of dependent arising developed in that chapter and in Chapter VII.
2. If suffering carne Crom itself,
Then it would not arise dependently.
￼Examination ofSuffering 203 For those aggregates
Arise in dependence on these aggregates.
Self-arising suffering would indeed be a candidate for inherent existence. But for the propgnent of a Buddhist analysis of suffer- ing, that is little help since suffering on a Buddhist analysis is the consequence of delusion, attachment, craving, action, and so forth. So such an analysis is not open to anyone wanting to defend the inherent existence of the suffering explored in the Four Noble Truths.
3. If those were different from        Or if these were different from those, Suffering could arise from another. These would arise from those others.
The next alternative-that suffering arises from another- requires that there be essential difference. For since suffering does arise from previous conditions, if there is genuine otherness, that would characterize the relation between suffering and its grounds.
4. If suffering were caused by a person himself, Theo who is that person-
By whom suffering is caused- Who exists distinct from suffering?
But who is that other? lt musi be the sufferer himself at another stage, or another individual altogether. If it is the person himself, then as the cause of suffering, he must be distinct from suffering. This poses two problems: First, as per the analysis of motion, desire, and agency in Chapters II, VI, and VIII above, we cannot conceive of the sufferer as inherently different from the suffering he experiences. For part of his identity is constituted by thai very suffering, and that suffering is his suffering. But second, given the framework of the first of the Four Noble Truths, a Buddhist phi- losopher such as Niigarjuna would share with any Buddhist inter- locutor the assumption thai in sa111siira sentient beings not only suffer, but are literally constituted of suffering-that every aggre- gate of a sentient being's existence is a cause, an effect, and a basis
￼204 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
of misery. So on either score, to distinguish sufferer from suffering
for the purpose of such an analysis would be impossible.
S. lf suffering comes from another person, Then who is that person-
When suffering is given by another-
Who exists distinct from suffering?
Another alternative is that the suffering is caused not by earlier stages of one's own life, but by another individual. That other indi- vidual of course could be someone else entirely, in the ordinary sense, or it could be an earlier moment of what is ordinarily re- garded as oneself, but which is for the purposes of this analysis regarded as substantially other. That is, taken in this way, Niigiir- juna can be seen to be arguing on each side of a dilemma with regard to the identity of persons across time. But if this were so, it would have to be the case that the person in whom suffering was caused by that other could be identified and that that person could be distin- guished from her suffering. But then the same problems developed above apply. Niigiirjuna emphasizes this in XII: 6:68
6. If another person causes suffering, Who is that other one
Who bestowed that suffering, Distinct from suffering?
7. When             is not established,
How could suffering be caused by another? Whoever caused the suffering of another Must have caused his own suffering.
But the suffering of that other person must either be caused by someone else or be              The former alternative leads to a regress: The whole point from the standpoint of the opponent who is the target of this argument is to find the independent explana-
68. In this case, there is a second difficulty as       For one person to cause suffering for another, that first must already be suffering. For to cause suffering is a very serious wrong, which       only be dane by somcone who him/herself is suffering. So there is a possible regress.
￼Examination o f Suffering 205
tory ground for suffering. The second altemative leads back to the problem scouted in the opening verses: Self-caused suffering is both inconceivable within a         Buddhist soteriological frame- work and runs afoul of the arguments against self-causation·gener- ally. Finally, it is rather embarrassingly ad hoc. Niigiirjuna sums this up in the next verse:
8. No suffering is self-caused. Nothing causes itself.
If another is not self-made,
How could suffering be caused by another?
But, as Niigiirjuna points out in Xll: 9, it can't be caused by both since we have seen that neither can be causally relevant at all to inherently existent suffering of a kind relevant to Buddhist doc- trine. And it is absurd to suppose that it is uncaused:
9. If suffering were caused by each, Suffering could be caused by both.
Not caused by self or by'other, How could suffering be uncaused?
10. Not only does suffering not exist In any of the fourfold ways:
No external entity exists
In any of the fourfold ways.
The fcmrfold analysis is, of course, thai in terms of the letralemma of causation. And Niigiirjuna is simply emphasizing that this refutation of the existence of inherently existing suffering is perfectly          No entity can arise from itself, from another, from both, or from a noncause. This was the burden of the first chapter. We must, of course, recall that this is not a refutation of the existence of the suffering we all experience and wish to avoid. Rather it is a demonstration of its emptiness of inherent existence. For just as the analysis in Chapter I has provided the key to dismiss- ing the inherent existence of suffering, the positive side of that same analysis can be used to recover its conventional existence. If by suffering we mean something dependently arisen, imperma-
￼206 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
nent, and conventional, existing only as imputed and only in rela- tion to its empty subjects, there is plenty of suffering to go around. But moreover, not only is the existence of suffering rendered comprehensible on this analysis, but so is the possibility of the alleviation of suffering. For if the proponent of the inherent exis- tence of suffering were correct, while it might seem thai suffering would then have a more solid status than that vouchsafed it by Niigarjuna's analysis in terms of emptiness, thai very substantial existence and hence independence of other conditions would make its alleviation impossible. For if it exists independently, then there are no conditions in the absence of which it fails to exist. So Niigiirjuna's analysis not only makes good sense of the first t r u t h - that of suffering-and by implication of the second-thai of the cause of suffering-but also opens the door for an analysis of the third and fourth truths-those of cessation and of the means to
cessation.
￼Chapter XIII
Examination of Compounded Phenomena
in this chapter, Niigiirjuna begins to develop the idea of emptiness more explicitly. Up to this point, he has been arguing that phenom· ena are empty, but has not been characterizing emptiness itself, or its relation to entitihood or to conventional reality, except by exam- ple and by implication. At this point, through a general discussion of all compounded phenomena-that is, all phenomena consti· tuted of parts or brought into being dependent upon causes-he argues explicitly both that emptiness is the lack of essence and that emptiness itself is wholly negative in character. it is not an essence !hat things have instead of whatever essence naive common sense or sophisticated reification might have thought they had-rather, it is the total lack ofessence or inherent existence. This is, hence, an anticipation of the explicit discussions of the emptiness of empti· ness to follow.

￼208 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
This is an important verse for any understanding of the relation of the two truths-the conventional and the ultimate-to one another. That relation is vexed because the conventional truth is sometimes referred to as a truth and sometimes as wholly false. Conventional phenomena are sometimes referred to as empirically real and not imaginary and sometimes as wholly imaginary.70 So it is important to see that the sense of "falsehood" in play when the conventional is characterized as false is '"deceptive." That is, insofar as conven· tional phenomena present themselves as more than conventional- as inherently'existent-thcy deceivc us. We take them to be what they are not-to be intrinsically identified, inherently existent en- tities. In that sense, they are false. But to the extent that we under- stand them as dependently arisen, empty, interdependent phenom- ena, they constitute a conventional truth. Yet one must bear in mind that, according to Nagarjuna, perception untutored by Madhya- mika philosophy and rigorous practice delivers objects to conscious- ness as inherently existent. In this sense, the things that we see are wholly false. For most of us, the best that we.can do is reason our way into knowing, but not seeing, their true nature. The goal of meditation on emptiness is to bring this knowledge into perceptual experience and, hence, to see things as they are.
2. If whatever is deceptive is false, What deceives?
The Victorious Conqueror71 has said about this That emptiness is completely true.
ena in general. Given the structure of the argument in this chapter, I (as do Tsong Khapa and his followers) prefer this reading. Kalupahana (p. 48) argues that it makes sense to follow 'a chapter on suffering with one on dispositions, inasmuch as the latter plausibly give rise to the former. He is right. But it also makes sense to follow a chapter on suffering with one on compounded phenomena since positing them as self-existent is what gives rise to suffering. Dispositions and compounded phenomena are-as the homonymy in question demonstrates-closely linked in Buddhist metaphysics. Dispositions are themselves compounded phenomena; but morc importantly, they are what lead us to the conceptual compounding that gives phenomena their status as conventional entities.
70. This, of course, is partially responsible for the kind of nihilistic misreading of the text one sees, e.g., in Wood (1994).

￼ExaminatiOn of Compounded Phenomena 209
The opponent then asks what we are deceived about. Here is what motivates the question: If there are no real tables, for in- stance, then when I believe that there is a table in front of me and am therefore deceived, what is deceiving me? We don't want to say that a nonexistent phenomenon is pretending to be existent since it would have to exist in order to pretend. Nagarjuna replies that what actually exists is an empty table. (That is not to say, however, that that .empty table is inherently existent-only that the correct way to characterize the entity that exists conventionally is as an "empty table.") That empty table is misperceived by an ordinary mind as a       existent table. To the extent that it appears as empty, it appears as it       is. In the first two lines of the next verse, Niigiirjuna notes that it is the absence of essence that per- mits change:
3. All things lack entity (hood),
Since change is perceived.
There is nothing without entity
Because all things have emptiness.
It is emptiness that makes change possible. If things had es- sences, they would be incapable of real change. But since they are seen to change, Nagiirjuna argues, they must be empty of essence. The opponent, though, rejoins: Since according to Niigiirjuna all things are empty and since this is their ultimate nature, all things in fact do have a kind of entitihood, namely, existence as empty phe- nomena. Niigiirjuna is here anticipating the charge that he has rejected other essences only to posit emptiness as an essence, sub- ject to all of the problems he has already adumbrated for essen- tialist metaphysics.
The opponent then asks (XIII: 4), " I f everything lacks being, and is therefore empty, what could change?" Change would seem to have to be change of something, and the doctrine of emptiness seems to rob us of those somethings. Niigiirjuna, hence, presents himself, in the voice of the opponent, with a dilemma: He seems to have propounded, his protestations to the contrary notwithstand- ing, a theory of the essence of all phenomena. That theory, accord- ing to this hypothetical objection, is that emptiness just is the es-
￼210 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
sence of all phenomena. He could deny having propounded such a theory, of course. But the consequence ofsuch a denial, the oppo- nent charges, would be no better. For then, the very basis of the argument here offered for emptiness-the reality of change- would have to be rejected. This is because without real entities there would no longer be a possible subject of change. Niigiirjuna replies in the third and fourth lines of XIII: 4 that the opponent has things backward: If there was entitihood-if things were nonempty- change would be impossible. It is emptiness itself that makes change comprehensible:
4. lf there is no entity (hood), What changes?
If there were entity,
How could it be correct that something changes?
Now Niigiirjuna begins a      explanation of how to understand change in the context of emptiness and of why entitihood would preclude change. This discussion is certainly grounded in the analy- sis in Chapter II, but is more explicitly tied to the         of emptiness at this point in the text:
5. A thing itself does not change.
Something different does not change.
Because a young man doesn't grow old,
And because and an old man doesn't grow old either.
When we imagine change, we imagine one thing retaining its identity, but changing its properties. But if identity is understood strictly, it is only possible as an interna! relation that a thing bears to itself. To the extent that a thing changes, it becomes,         speaking, a different thing. But the relation between two things is not the change of a thing-it is simply the difference between two nonchanging entities. A young man does not grow old. When he is old he is no longer a young man. The relation between the young man and the old man is simply the difference of two things. But an old man doesn't grow old either. He is already old. So if change
￼Examination ofCompounded Phenomena 211 and things thai change are thought of nonrelationally, we can make
no sense of change at all.
6. I f a thing itself changed, Milk itself would be curd.
Or curd would have come to be
An entity different from milk.
If we think of identity persisting through change, there is a single thing thai changes as conventionally, milk becomes curd. Since thai thing is identical to milk and to curd, by transitivity we would have to say thai curd and milk are identical. But no one would want to pul curd in his/her tea! The only way to avoid this result while retaining the idea that milk and curd are entities would be to consider them to be wholly different entities. In that case, there is stili no change in an entity-only the difference between two unre- lated phenomenan
7. If there were even a trifte nonempty, Emptiness itself would be but a trifte. But not even a trifle is nonempty. How could emptiness be an entity?
Verses 7 and 8 are critical for any understanding of the subtle doctrine Niigiirjuna is developing of the emptiness of emptiness. In XIII: 7, Niigiirjuna is emphasizing thai emptiness is not one of the many properties thai a thing might or might not have. lt is not that some things are empty and some are nonempty, or thai all things happen to be empty although they might have been otherwise. Emptiness is important because it is the only way thai things can exist. Moreover, emptiness is not an entity. lt is not a distinct phenomenon to which other phenomena are related. lt is exactly
72. My reading of these last two vcrses appears to conflict with that of Inada (1970), who reads Niigiirjuna as herc denying that there is change. Rather. I take it. Nagarjuna denies that there is any inherently existent change or aoy substantial entity that could be the subject of change. in virtue of the conventional reality of change and the changed.

the emptiness of all phenomena.n The conventional character of
             entities and their emptiness are one and the same.
8. The victorious ones have said
Thai emptiness is the relinquishing of all views.
For whomever emptiness is a view,
Thai one will accomplish nothing.
The sense of "view" (Tib: lta-ba, Skt:        at work in verse 8 is crucial. By a view, Niigiirjuna here means a theory on the same       of discourse at which reificationist-nihilist debates proceed. A view in this sense is a view about what does or does not exist when existence is taken to mean inherent existence, or about the nature of phenomena, presupposing that the idea of a nature is coherent. So both the theory thai compounded phenomena exist in virtue of having natures and identities and the theory that since they don't have such natures and identities they don't exist at all are views in this sense. Both presuppose that things exist at all if and only if they do so inherently. But the analysis in terms of emptiness is not a view at all in this sense. For the claim is not that things exist in virtue of having the property of emptiness as an essence. Rather it is the claim that they are empty because they have no essence.
lt is also very important to see that this understanding of what a view is is closely bound up with Niigiirjuna's account of assertion and of the role of language in Miidhyamika dialectic. For Niigiir- juna, assertion in the litera! sense is always the ascription of a property to an entity. As long as we are talking from the conven- tional standpoint, there is no problem here. There are plenty of conventional entities and conventional properties to go around and, so, lots of available conventionally true assertions. That is the basis of conventional truth. li is also important to note here thai
73. So here I agree with Wood (1994. p. 174) when he concludes that the purport of this verse is that emptiness is not an entity. But unlike Wood, I do not think that entails a nihilism with respect to emptiness. lt remains a characteristic of all phenomena (including itself) and, hence, Jike them, is conventionally real. See also Siderits (1989).
￼Examination ofCompounded Phenomena 213
corresponding to these conventional assertions are real proposi- tions that make them true or false-·entities with or without the ascribed properties. Again, as long as we remain and are aware !hat we remain within the framework of conventional designation and conventional assertion, this poses no problems.
But, when we start to do metaphysics, it is easy to slip into
nonsense: For now, when we want to characterize the essence of a
thing, we take ourselves to be positing a non-conventional thing and ascribing to it an essential property. And there not only are no such things, but there are not even possibly such things. There is no ultimate way the wo,rld is that we are characterizing,       or falsely.
The danger to which Nagarjuna is here adverting with respect to Miidhyamika philosophy (of treating Madhyamika as a view) is then connected to assertion in the following way: If one were to think thai in asserting that things are empty thai one is positing entities and ascribing to those independent entities the property of emptiness, one would be treating the language of Madhyamika as ' making         assertions. But from the standpoint from which these would be true, there are no entities and no characteristics, and a fortiori, there are no entities having the characteristic of being empty. The language must hence be understood, from the ultimate perspective, not as making assertions, but rather as ostending-indicating thai which cannot be literally asserted with- out falling into nonsense-as Wittgenstein puts it in the Tractatus, showing thai which cannot be said.
Nagarjuna makes this much more explicit in his discussion of positionlessness in Vigrahavyiivartanf XXI-XXVIll, where he ex- plicitly denies that the Madhyamika assert any propositions, in virtue of there being no entities or properties presupposed by their use of language existing independently and corresponding to the words used. Aryadeva makes the same point at               XVI: 21. Candrakirti in his comments on these verses compares one who treats emptiness as an essential propeny-as opposed to the lack of any essential propeny, thus treating Madhyamika language as assertoric in the sense of asserting the view that all things have the essential nature of emptiness-to one who, upon entering a shop
￼214 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
and learning thai there are no wares for sale, asks the shopkeeper to sell him the "no wares."74,75
To hold a view of emptiness-to reify it and then attribute it to phenomena-would then involve simultaneously reifying those phe- nomena as having a fixed nature and denying their existence at all, in virtue of disparaging theirconventional reality as unreality by con- tras! with the reality of emptiness. lt is this incoherence, so charac- teristic of essentialist philosophies, thai leads Nagarjuna to assert thai one holding such a view is completely hopeless-incapable of accomplishing anything, philosophically or soteriologically.10.77
74. Murti (1985) puts this point nicely: "Criticism of theories is no theory. Criticism is but the awareness of what a theory is, how it is made up, it is not the proposing of a new theory. Negation of positions is not one more position" (p. xxiii).
See also Siderits (1989) for an interesting discussion of the connection between Nagarjuna's claim to positionlessness and contemporary antirealism. Siderits puts the pciint this way: ·
[Nagarjuna] neither asserts nor intimates any daims about the ultimate nature of reality, for he takes the very notion of a way that the world is independently of our cognitive activity to be devoid of meaning. . . . The slogan 'The ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth' is merely a striking way of putting the point that an acceptable canon of rationality will have to refl.ect human needs, interest, and institutions. (p. 6)
I am neither completely comfortable with Siderits's construction of the contempo- rary realism-antirealism debate nor with his location of NB.giirjuna on the antirealist side. (I rather think that N&lt;igiirjuna would reject the presupposition of that debate-that the relevant sense of "real" is coherent in the first place.) But the connection he establishes between positionlessness and the rejection of a realist ontology is instructive.
All of this will become much more explicit (if not much clearer) in the discus- sions in XXII, XXIV, XXV, and XXVII below. I discuss this at grcater length in Garfield (unpublished).
75. Ng (1993). however, argues that this verse should be rcad "all false views." So he claims that, according to Nagarjuna, to understand emptiness is to relinquish all false views and that anyone who holds false views about emptiness is incurable. But Niigiirjuna doesn't say this, and the interpretation seems unfounded. See pp. 18-25.
76. The Tibetan "bsgrub-tu-med-pa" (will accomplish nothing) translates the Sanskrit term "asddhyan," which ca!J also be translated "incurable."
77. This does not en      however. pace Sprung (1979, p. 9, 15-16), that nothing is intelligible. N3g3rjuna spends a good deal of time developing quitc lucid analyses of conventional phenomena and their relation toemptiness. What fails to be intelligible is, rather, the idea of inherent existence. But since no phenomena exist that way. and since emptiness is intelligible, the actual nature of phenomena is intelligible.
￼Examination of Compounded Phenomena 215
This argument against the coherence of any understanding of emptiness as itself an essence is tied very tighily to the analysis in Chapter XXIV: 18-40 of the emptiness of emptiness and of the connection between emptiness, dependent arising, and convention and tied most directly to the concluding verse of the text, XXVII: 30. (The commentaries on XXIV: 36 and XXVII: 30 below may be useful in elucidating this verse as well.) lt is clearly an early antici- pation of the powerful and climactic conclusions drawn in those two discussions.
￼ChapterXIV Examination of Connection
The word here translated as "connection" (phrad-pa) is the term denoting the relation between the components that are com- pounded in any compounded phenomenon. lt can also describe the relation between two things coming together in space and time or colliding, or two things fitting together, and while this can be taken fairly literally in the context of physical objects when they are understood as compounded of their parts, the relation is actually much more         than that. In fact, the example that Niigiirjuna takes as central, and one that is used by some earlier Buddhist theorists as an example of a case of con- nection in this sense, is visual perception. In such a case, accord- ing to the proponent of the reality of meeting, or compounding, the subject, the sensory organs, the sensory faculty, and the object join together, or "connect," not in a         physical sense of spatiotemporal coincidence, but rather in the sense of form- ing an ensemble. Sense perception is, on this view, the entire compound ensemble.
So, dialectically, this chapter follows quite naturally on the heels of the examination of compounded entities. For we can imagine an opponent might reason as follows: Niigiirjuna may be right indeny- ing the inherent existence of compounded entities in virtue of their dependence upon their parts and upon their parts being com- pounded, but surely since these phenomena depend upon being
￼Examination of Connection 217 compounded thai relation-the connection-exists. This chapter
is aimed at replying to this position.
1. The seen, seeing, and the seer: These three-pairwise or
All together-
Do not coQnect to one another,
First, he claims, these things simply don't occur in the same place at the same time. There is no litera! sense in which they connect.
2. Similarly desire, the desirous one, the object of desire, And the remaining affl.ictions
And the remaining sources of perception Are understood in this threefold way.
In the various chapters on the relation between characteristic and characterized, Nagarjuna has argued that it makes no sense to think of the relation between individuals and their properties or between entities as any kind of relation between independent en- tities at all, and that these phenomena cannot be understood as the same, as different, or as neither.
3. Since different things connect to one another, But in seeing, etc.,
There is no difference, They cannot connect.
In order to have things that connect in the relevant sense, they must be different from one another, but as we saw in the chapters on characteristics, on desire, on seeing, on action, on motion, and on the self, the differences of the relevant kind are not found on analysis.
4. Not only in seeing, etc . . . Is there no such difference:
When one thing and another are simultaneous, lt is also not tenable that there is difference.
￼218 THE T.EXT AND COMMENTARY
This problem emerges not only in the analysis of intuitively uni- tary phenomena like vision, but is perfectly          Things that are separate from one another cannot be coherently thought of as inherently different entities either. For without any inherent iden- tity, there is no basis for inherent difference. This recalls the argu- ment of Chapter I.
5. A different thing depends on a different thing for its
difference.
Without a different thing, a different thing wouldn't be
different.
It is not tenable for thai which depends on something else To be different from it.
For there to be substantial difference, it must be possible to independently establish the identity and natures of the relata. But this, Niigiirjuna has argued repeatedly, is impossible.
6. l f a different thing were different from a different thing, Without a different thing, a different thing could exist.
But without that different thing, thai different thing does not
exist.
It follows thai it doesn't exist.
That is, the only way that difference or the identity of a different thing as different could be shown to exist inherently would be for that difference to be present independently of the existence of another different thing. But that is not so. The only alternative would be to argue that difference is present independently in single things. But this ignores the relational character of difference.
7. Difference is not in a different thing. Nor is it in a nondifferent thing.
lf1 difference does not exist,
Neither different nor identical things exist.
So difference cannot be located either as a relation between things or as a unary prnperty of individual things. So there is no inherently existent difference. But it is the existence of inherent
￼Examination of Connection 219 difference that grounds the problem of connection. So there is no
such relation, and no problem to be solved.
8. That does not connect to itself.
Nor do different things connect to one another. Neither connection nor
Connected nor connector exist.
The conclusion is a powerful one and, especially when conjoined with the conclusion of the previous chapter, goes to the heart of any Buddhist (or non-Buddhist, for that matter) ontology that seeks to reify the entities that appear at any stage ofontological analysis. lt is quite tempting when examining dependent, compound phenomena to think that while they themselves       not be inherently existent, and might not be the ultimate entities of the empirical world, it must at least be a fundamental fact that their being constituted of parts, or dependent upon their location in a causal and mereological nexus, exists as a fact. That would seem, in fact, to be the natural way to interpret the doctrine of dependent origination and the emptiness of macroscopic entities. But Niigiirjuna here       the rug out from any such analysis, pointing again to the emptiness of emptiness: Not only are compounded phenomena empty of inherent existence, but so is the relation among their constituents and determinants in vir- tue of which they are compounded.
￼ChapterXV Examination of Essence
This chapter continues the discussion begun in Chapter XIII and carried on in Chapter XIV of the fundamental nature of things and the· relation between emptiness and existence. Here Niigiirjuna rejects the coherence of the concept of essence and explores its ramifications for the concept of inherent existence, the concept of an entity, and the concept of a nonentity. This chapter is also aimed at            any nihilistic interpretation of the Miidhyamika philo- sophical orientation and in explaining the deep connection be- tween the analysis of phenomena as empty of essence and the demonstration of the possibility of empirical reality.
1. Essence arising from
Causes and conditions makes no sense.
If essence carne from causes and conditions. Then it would be fabricated.
Essence by definition is eternal and independent. So it can't arise dependently. Chapter XV: 1, 2 develop this point directly. But since all entities arise dependently, it follows that none of them have essence.78
78. But see Bhattacharya (1979). pp. 341-42, for a contrary view. Bhattacharya argues that we can make sense of dependent,            essences. Perhaps. But
￼Examination of Essence 221
2. How could it be appropriate
For fabricated essence to come to be? Essence itself is not artificial
And does not depend on another.
In these first two verses, Nagarjuna indicates the three cardinal characteristics of an essence: An essence (or an entity that exists in virtue of possessing an essence) is uncaused, independent of other phenomena, and not fabricated from other things. Jt is important to bear this in mind in any Madhyamika analysis of emptiness. For when Nagarjuna argues that phenomena are all empty, it is o f es- sence in this sense that they are empty. Hence, when Nagarjuna ar- gues that all phenomena originate in dependence upon conditions, that all phenomena are interdependent, and that all phenomena are fabricated (both in virtue of being compounded from parts and    virtue of acquiring their identity as particulars through conceptual imputation), he is thereby arguing quite directly for their emptiness.
3. If there is no essence,
How can there be difference in entities? The essence of difference in entities
Is what is called the entity of difference.
This is an echo of the argument about difference presented in Chapter I. Essential difference presupposes essences of individu- als. So any argument against individual essence will count as an argument against essential difference.
4. Without having essence or                    How can there be entities?
If there are essences and entities Entities are established.
The concept of an inherently existent entity is the concept of an entity with an essence. So without essence, there are no inherently existing entities.
these are not the essences Nagarjuna has in mind and are not those that lie behind the kind of pemicious reification or its counterpart, nihilism, that he is out to extirpate.
￼222 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
5. If the entity is not established, A nonentity is not established.
An entity that has become different Is a nonentity,        say.
By a nonentity, Nagarjuna means something inherently differ- ent from some existing entity. A nontable in this sense would be inherently different from a table. But a nonexistent in         would be a Meinongian subsistent which is available as a basis of predication but is intrinsically different from what it is to be an existent-a real thing possessed of the property of being nonexis- tent. Just as a table most be established as a determinate entity in order to establish the nature of nontables, existence most be established as an inherently existent property in order to establish the parallel status of nonexistence. But neither tables nor exis- tence can be so established. By the same token, then, there are no inherently established nontables, nor any inherently estab- lished nonexistents in their stead. So even though it might appear that an analysis through emptiness would leave us only with nontables and nonexistent phenomena, it doesn't even leave us with that (inherently), though it leaves us with plenty of tables, nontables, existents, and nonexistents                  
6. Those who see essence and essential difference And entities and nonentities,
They do not see
The truth taught by the Buddha.
If the only way that one can think about phenomena is to think of them as things with inherent natures and to think of things without soch natures as thereby nonexistent, none of the Buddhist doctrines of impermanence, emptiness, or liberation will make any sense.
7. The Victorious One, through knowledge
Of reality and unreality,
In the Discourse to Katydyana, Refuted both "it is" and "it is not."
￼Examination of Essence 223
In the Discourse Io Kiilyiiyana, the Buddha argues thai to assert that things exist inherently is to fali into the extreme of reification, to argue thai things do not exist at all is to fali into the extreme of nihilism, and to follow the middle way is neither to assert in an unqualified way that things exist nor in an unqualified way thai things do not exist. It represents one of the fundamental sultas of the Pali canon for Mahiiyiina philosophy. In the suita, the Buddha claims thai reification derives from the failure to note imperma- nence and leads to grasping, craving, and the attendant suffering. Nihilism, he claims, is motivated by the failure to note the empiri- cal reality of arising phenomena. lt leads to suffering from failure to take life, others, and morality seriously enough. The middle path of conventional existence leads to engagement in the world without attachment.79
8. If existence were through essence, Then there would be no nonexistence. A change in essence
Could never be tenable.
If for a thing to exist were for it to be a determinate entity with an essence, then no thing would ever cease to exist or change in any way. For an essential property is a necessary property, and it is incoherent to say that a thing loses a necessary property.
9. lf there is no essence, What could become other?
If there is essence,
What could become other?
In the first half of this verse, the opponent replies that since the argument in the previous verse presupposes the reality of change,
79. Kalupahana (1986) relies on this verse to argue that the entire MUlamad- hyamakak4rikd is a "grand commentary on the Discourse to Kdtyiiyana" (pp. 81, 232). White this sutta is clearly important for Nigirjuna, nothing in the _tcxt justifies this global interpretation. The range of topics Nigirjuna considers far exceeds the scope of that sutta, and no other passage from that sutta is mentioned in the Malamadhyamakakiirikli.
￼224 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
it must presuppose the reality of the changer. If it presupposes the reality of change, it presupposes the reality of things that change and, hence, that persist through time. In order to remajn the same, there must be some essence that accounts for this identity. Niigiir- juna replies, however, that if this persistence through time were determined by essence, the change it putatively explains would be impossible. Only conventional existence over time can explain change. Niigiirjuna summarizes, paraphrasing the Discourse to Kiityiiyana:
10. To say "it is" is to grasp for permanence.
To say "it is not" is to adopt the view of nihilism. Therefore a wise person
Does not say "exists" or "does not exist."
11. '"Whatever exists through its essence
Cannot be nonexistenf' is eternalism. "lt existed before but doesn't now" Entails the error of nihilism.so
To say thai if something exists, it does so in virtue of having an essence and hence cannot change or pass out of existence would entail the absurd position thai everything is etemal. To say of something that it existed in this strong sense-with an essence-in the past, but does not do so now, is absurd. For if for something to exist is for it to do so inherently, and if it is not now existent, it could never have been. So since everything we observe is imperma- nent, if the only existence thai there could be were inherent exis- tence, nothing could exist at all. That would be nihilism. The upshot of this chapter is. thai the very concept of an essence, and hence the very concept of an inherently          entity at all, is incoherent. No coherent conception of the phenomenal world can be one .in which things are posited other than conventionally.81
80. The verse ends "...thai-bar 'gyur." This form indicates that the nihilism is taken as the unacceptable consequence that would provide a reductio on the claim "it existed before but doesn't now."
81. See Ng (1993), pp. 25-27, 34-36, for a nice discussion of the connection between tbis rejection of extremes and the emptiness of emptiness.
￼ChapterXVI Examination of Bondage
So there areno entities. But stili, from a Buddhist perspective, we are bound: bound to our conceptions of entities and essence, bound to nur sdves, bound to objects, and principally, bound to cyclic existence itself. Surely, the opponent might ask, mustn't the bondage that accounts for the illusions so ruthlessly analyzed in the previous chapter be intrinsically real? If not, what is the causal basis for all of these illusions and all of this suffering? In a Buddhist framework, this bondage to cyclic existence is instantiated in end- less transmigration in salllsiira, and freedom from bondage would be liberation from cyclic existence inio nirvai:ia. We will postpone a discussion of the precise nature of that liberation and of nirvai:ia until we reach the chapters where that topie is discussed, namely, XXII and XXV. Niigiirjuna begins with an examination of transmi- gration and the entity that transmigrates:
1. If compounded phenomena transmigrate,s2 They do not transmigrate as permanent.
82. The Tibetan term translated as "transmigrate" ('khor, Skt:           is a cog- n a t e o f t h e t e r m "samsara," o r c y c l i c e x i s t e n c e . l t l i t e r a l l y m e a n s g o a r o u n d a n d c o u l d also be translated with justice as „flow." But the root idea here is that of cycling or circulating or participating in a phenomenal reality conceived as multicyclic. In this chapter, as in Chapter XIII, I opt to           " 'du byed" as "compounded phenom- ena," rather than, as Kalupahana.(1986) does. "dispositions." This follows the Ti- betan commentarial tradit.ion and makes better sense of t.he argument.
￼226 THE TEXT 11.ND COMMENTARY
If they are impermanent they do not transmigrate.
The same approach         to sentient beings.
Nagarjuna sets up a by now familiar destructive dilemma: Either compounded phenomena-of which sentient beings, the beings who are bound, are instances-are permanent or impermanent. Let us just consider the compounded phenomena who are sentient and hence who transmigrate: If they are thought of as permanent, they cannot transmigrate because transmigration involves, by defi- nition, change. And what is permanent, as we have seen, cannot change. But if they are impermanent, then they do not endure through time and, hence, cannot transmigrate. So no sentient be- ing considered as an inherent entity can be conceived of as a trans- migrator in cyclic existence.
2. If someone transmigrates,
Then if, when sought in the fivefold way
In the aggregates and in the sense spheres and in the elements, He is not there, what transmigrates?
Given that no inherently existent person can be found upon analysis as the bearer of the aggregates, as identical to the aggre- gates, as different from the aggregates, as the collection of the aggregates, or as the arrangement of the aggregates, and mutatis mutandis for other possible modes of analysis in terms of domains of knowledge or experience and in terms of basie elements, it follows that there is no inherently existent subject of transmigra- tion. If the transmigrator cannot be identified on analysis, though, neither can the transmigration itself. lt will follow that there is no inherently existent transmigration and, hence, no inherently exis- tent bondage to cyclic existence.
3. If one transmigrates from grasping83 to grasping, then One would be nonexistent.
Neither existent nor grasping, Who could this transmigrator be?

￼Examination o f Bondage 227
"Grasping" here refers primarily to grasping the aggregates as one's self. Transmigration-or for thai matter continuation within one life, which from the Miidhyamika perspective is exactly the same kind of process-involves moving from grasping one set of phenomena as one's self to grasping another in the same way. That is one of the most fundamental delusions from a Buddhist standpoint. But grasping can also be the grasping of an object as an object, or the clinging to possessions. Life in saljlsiira, Niigiirjuna would insist, can equally well be characterized in any of these ways. But if in order to exist as an individual one would have to retain one's iden- tity over time since on this view it is of the very nature of cyclic existence thai one constantly changes from one moment to another, then it would follow thai no subject exists. But if there is no subject of grasping, there can be no grasping. So, on the supposition thai to exist and to transmigrate is to exist as a continuing entity, there is no way to make sense of the phenomenal world. So an inherently existent grasper, posited in order to guarantee the reality of cyclic existence, in fact makes the reality of cyclic existence incoherent.
4. How could compounded phenomena pass into nirv3J)a? That would not be tenable.
How could a sentient being pass into nirv3IJa?
That would not be tenable.
lf compounded phenomena are permanent, grasping is perma- nent. And if grasping is permanent, saljlsara is permanent. And if saljlsiira is pernianent, then nirviil)a is impossible. But the philoso- pher who is positing inherently existent boodage is doing so in order to defend a Buddhist perspective on cyclic existence and nirviil)a. This is precisely the motivation for the reification-the worry that saljlsiira and nirviil)a are, if not inherently existent, nonexistent. So this conclusion is inadmissible for such an opponent.
5. All compounded phenomena are arising and ceasing things: Not bound, not released.
For this reason a sentient being Is not bound, not released.
￼228 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Neither bondage nor release can be seen as inherently existent, nor as inherent properties of sentient beings. This is the conclusion of the argument that follows. Nagarjuna first considers bondage as an inherent property, and then liberation:
6. l f grasping were bondage,
Then the one who is grasping would not be bound. But one who is not grasping is not bound.
In what circumstances will one be bound?
If grasping is identified with the property of bondage, then the continuity of bondage across transmigration is inexplicable: The problem is that grasping is not only the cause, but is also the effect of bondage. Delusion by which we are bound, from a Buddhist perspective, leads us to grasp at things; that grasping perpetuates delusion and bondage. To the extent that we grasp onto external phenomena or onto the self as inherently existent, we are bound to the delusions that constitute·and ground saQ1siira. To the extent that we are bound in delusion, we continue to grasp. The bondage is hence not only conditioned by, but overarches, particular in- stances of grasping. But we don't want to infer from the fact that grasping and bondage are not identical that the relinquishing of all grasping would not free one. The task is then to figure out the nature of bondage, which musi be conceived as relational.
7. lf prior to binding There is a bound one,
There would be bondage, but there isn't.
The rest has been explained by the gone, the not-gone, and the .goer.
The only way thai bondage itself could be an inherently existent phenomenon would be if it could exist prior to and independently of a bound sentient being. But then the case would be strictly analogous to motion (as well as to severa! other analysands we have considered so far). That is, just as there is no motion apart from the mover, there is no bondage apart from the bound. The argument can be applied in a strictly parallel way.
￼Examination o f Bondage 229
8. Whoever is bound is not released.
Whoever is not bound does not get released.
If a bound one were being released,
Bondage and release would occur simultaneously.
Nagarjuna then recalls another argument from Chapter II, the argument against the possibility of the beginning of motion. There, Nagarjuna argued that motion could not begin in a stationary ob- ject since it is not moving, nor in a moving object since it is already in motion. And there can be no moment when a thing is both moving and stationary, nor any moment when an entity is neither. Similarly, nirviiQa cannot arise in one in saqtsftra. nor in     al· ready in nirval)a. One cannot be simultaneously in samsara and nirval)a. Nor is there any third option.
9. ••[, without grasping, will pass beyond sorrow, And I will attain nirv3.Q.a," one says.
Whoever grasps like this
Has a great grasping.
There is a stylistic feature in this verse thai deserves note: The pronoun "I" (bdag) is uncharacteristically fronted in the sentence and is emphasized with the focus particie (ni). Nagarjuna is hence drawing attention to the fact thai the individual in whose mouth this       is pul is grasping to his own identity as an agent and as a continuing subject both through samsara and into nirval)a. This grasping onto self, he suggests, precludes the nirval)a the speaker craves. But Nagarjuna presents another argument as well: li is also possible to grasp after nirval)a-to reify it as a state and to crave it as a phenomenon inherently different from samsara and as highly desirable since it is indeed characterized as liberation from suffer- ing. But this grasping onto the end of grasping is itself a grasping and so precludes the attainment of nirval)a. Nirval)a requires, ac- cording to Nagarjuna, a complete cessation of grasping, including that onto nirval)a itself. While that might seem paradoxical, it is not: To grasp onto something in this sense requires, inter alia, that one reify it. By refusing to reify liberation, in virtue of seeing it as the corelative of bondage, which itself is not inherently existent, it
￼230 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
is possible to pursue the path to liberation without creating at the same time a huge obstacle on !hat path-the root delusion with regard to nirval)a itself. Possible, that is, but perhaps not that easy.84.ss
10. When you can't bring about nirviil)a,
Nor the purification of cyclic existence,
What is cyclie existence,
And what is the nirvRQa you examine?
Anyone who is subject to either of these pathologies-grasping to one's self or grasping for nirval)a-is incapable of attaining that peace. So, Nagarjuna urges, in order to make such progress possi- ble, one should reexamine one's conception of the nature of phe- nomena in cyclic existence (both oneself and external phenomena) and nirval)a itself. By coming to see their ultimate emptiness, he suggests, one can relinquish that grasping and attain that liberation.
Neither nirval)a nor sal)lsara are inherently existent. Ultimately both are nonexistent. So, what, Nagarjuna asks rhetorically, are they? The answer is that they are conventionally real, dependently arisen phenomena that are empty of inherent existence. In virtue of that fact, it is possible to escape the former and to attain the latter. But that escape would be impossible were they inherently existent and is impossible for anyone who takes them to be so.
84. In               11, Nagarjuna asserts "This is nirv8.JJa in this very life!" He emphatically rejects the positing of nirvana as a distinct entity divorced from samsara. This will emerge much more explicitly in the discussion of nirvai:ia in XXV below.
85. It is also important to note that this indicates a difference in kind between grasping for nirv!l.Qa and an aspiration to attain buddhahood. For it is central to Mahayiina Buddhist practice to develop the altruistic aspiration to attain buddha- hood for the sake of all sentient beings-to enhance one's knowledge, skill, and compassion so as to maximally benefit others. But this aspiration can be cultivated without reification of self, of the goal, or of the objects of compassion or          and, hence, without grasping of the kind at issue.
￼Chapter XVII
Examination of Actions and Their Fruits
Arguing for the emptiness of bondage and liberation, however, raises a further question that demands an answer: If there is no real bondage and no real release, what are the effects of our actions? For it would appear, at least given standard Buddhist moral theory and the doctrine of karma on which it is grounded,86 that meritori- ous actions conduce to liberation and that morally wrong actions increase bondage. Given the emptiness of these latter, an analysis of the consequences of action is in order. Niigiirjuna begins with Buddhist mora! truisms, accepted by the Miidhyamika as well as by members of other Buddhist schools. It is important to note that the first nineteen verses of this chapter represent the views of four distinct opponents in order of increasing similitude to the Mad- hyamika understanding. Despite the fact that Niigiirjuna sets these views up as targets, however, some of the views the opponents put on the table are, suitably interpreted, shared by Niigiirjuna. Each
86. That is, broadly speaking, that our actions, words, and intentions have consequences that determine the future course of our lives. Karma from the Bud- dhist standpoint is a straightforwardly deterministic process and not a matter of accounts being kept by a cosmic accountant. The doctrine can be applied both within a single life or across rebirths and with respect both to individuals and to groups of individuals.
￼232 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
can be seen as, despite being inadmissible as a                 of a nonconventional basis for the relation between action and its ef- fects, a reasonable empirical assessment of at least part of the conventional reality in this domain.
I. Self-restraint and benefiting others
With a compassionate mind is the Dharma. This is the seed for
Fruits in this and future lives.
2. The Unsurpassed Sage has said
That actions are either intention or intentional. The varieties of these actions
Have been announced in many ways.
The classification to which Niigiirjuna refers is a partttlon of actions into mental and physical. Mental actions are mere inten- tions on this view; physical actions and speech (generally distin- guished in Buddhist psychology and action theory) are properly intentional. That is, the latter two involve a mental and a nonmen- tal component; the mental actions only involve a mental compo- nent. Verse 3 clarifies this:
3. Of these, what is called "intention" Is mental desire.
What is called "intentional"
Comprises the physical and verba!.
In the next verse, an opponent uses these truisms as a platform for the defense of the view that actions themselves must remain in existence until their consequences are observed. Actions that de- rive from renouncing the world are different from those that derive from worldly concerns. This difference in nature) he argues, must explain the difference in their consequences:
4. Speech and action and all
Kinds of unabandoned and abandoned actions
￼Examination of Actions and Their Fruits 233 And resolve87
As well as ...
5. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions Derived from pleasure,
As      as intention and morality: These seven88 are the kinds of action.
The kinds of actions to which Niigiirjuna's imaginary opponent refers are simply the various kinds of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. In                  good actions are done for the sake of pleasure for others;         bad actions sacrifice others' good for one's own pleasure. The opponent, however, goes further, point- ing out that these actions have diverse long-term consequences that must be explained:
6. If until the time of ripening
Action bad to remain in place, it would have to be permanent. If it has ceased, then having ceased,
How will a fruit arise?
The problem is this: Given that the consequence of an action may be far in the future, something ·must persist to connect the action to the result. This is a kind of karmie analog of doubts about action at a distance. It is the same kind of move that lies behind trace theories of memory in recent philosophy of mind. So this first position is that there must be some permanent entity that remains in existence until the consequences of an action occur.
A second possibility is that some third thing mediates the rela- tion between action and consequence-a kind of karmie link thai is generated by the action and remains in the psychophysical contin-

Tsong Khapa has it like this: (1) good and bad speech; (2) good and bad physical action; (3) abandoned and unabandoned actions; (4) meritorious actions; (5) nonmeritorious actions; (6) the intention to do good actions; (7) the intention to do bad actions. Just what the principle of partition is herc is not obvious. Clearly the categories overlap (pp. 300-301).
￼234 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
uum until the consequence is produced. The interlocutor then of-
fers an analogy popular in Buddhist philosophy:
7. As for a continuum, such as the sprout, It comes from a seed.
Prom that arises the fruit. Without a seed, It would not come into being.
That is, just as every actual fruit requires an actual seed as its predecessor and a sprout to mediate between them, the opponent reasons, every consequence of action requires an actual action and an actual karmie link between the action and the consequence. The next three verses extend this analogy:
8. Since from the seed comes the continuum,
and from the continuum comes the fruit,
The seed precedes the fruit.
Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.
Thai is, this interlocutor points out, the position developed in XVII: 5-6 requires that actions either be permanent or nonexis- tent. His own view, on the other hand, allows actions to exist as impermanent and is, hence, more plausible:
9. So, in a mental continuum, Prom a preceding intention
A consequent mental state arises. Without this, it would not arise.
10. Since from the intention comes the continuum,
And from the continuum the fruit arises,
Action precedes the fruit.
Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.
In the next verse, another opponent offers an orthodox formula- tion from a substantialist Buddhist school, arguing that particular kinds of action are described as the methods of attaining realiza- tion and thai particular rewards for the practicioner are mentioned
￼Examination of Actions and Their Fruits 235 as consequences of realization. The implication is thai, since these
are specified in sutras as real, they must be inherently existent:
11. The ten pure paths of action
Are the method of realizing the Dharma.
These fruits of the Dharma in this and other lives Are the five pleasures.
"The ten paths" simply denotes the totality of virtuous actions as characterized by one of the Buddhist botanies of morally worthy action.89 The live pleasures are the pleasures appropriate to the various sense faculties. According to the opponent, all we need to do in order to reach enlightenment and to lead good lives is to act virtuously. The principal consequence of this is that we will enjoy temporal happiness.
Yet another interlocutor replies thai this wholly misunderstands the Buddha's explanation of the relation between action and its consequences. While it is the case thai acting well is an iinportant ingredient in Buddhist practice and in any account of what i.I is to lead a good life, and while it is true thai when one lives well, one in         is rewarded with          happiness, this hardly indi- cates thai action, the agent, or the consequences of action are inherently existent.·Rather, this more sophisticated opponent sug- gests, the nature of the link is completely abstract, like a legal obligation:90

90. Kalupahana (1986) misreads XVII: 12-19 as N.iig.iirjuna's own view. This is understandable, as Nilgiirjuna is providing four rival accounts of the relation be- tween action and its karmie                Each on his view contains a kemel or truth; each is indeed accurate in a sense, though misleading in the sense in which it is intended. This fina! position is closest to Nagiirjuna's position and can easily be confused with it, but to read it this way misses the significance of the transition at XVII: 20.

I will then explain what is tenable here: The analysis propounded by all Buddhas, self-conquerors
And disciples according to which . . .
Action is like an uncancelled promissory note
And like a debt.
Of the realms it is          Moreover, its nature is neutral.
Using the metaphor of a promissory note, the defender of this view compares action and its consequences to a document attesting to a particular debt or other !egal action: Though the act to which the document attests was in one sense momentary, its conse- quences, and the evidence of its reality, are unlimited in duration. So the consequences of any action-however loca! that action might appear to be-reverberate through all realms of existence.91 More- over, the.fundamental nature of action and its consequences is neu- tral. Thai is, simply considered as such, on this view, neither action nor its consequent trace is either positive or negative. Any particu- lar action or trace may of course be so-but action itself is equally capable of being positive or negative in character. We now turn to specific advice to enable one to realize the nature of reality and to abandon the mundane concerns and attachments thai lead to bind- ing actions (advice with which Nagarjuna would not take issue):
15. By abandoning, that is not abandoned.
Abandonment occurs through meditation.
Therefore, through the nonexpired,
The fruit of action arises.
Simply by resolving to abandon attachment one cannot thereby succeed in shedding it. It is difficult to accomplish this. Attachment arises as a consequence of the persistent, pervasive psychological, verba!, and physical habits thai together constitute what Buddhist philosophers call the "root delusion," the ignorance of the true
91. The four realms reflect traditional Buddhist cosmology: the desire realm, the form realm, the          realm, the realm of freedom.
￼Examination o f Actions and Their Fruits 237
nature of things. That delusion consists in confusing existence with inherent existence and issues inevitably in one of the two extreme views-reification or nihilism. Only through extensive meditation on the nature of phenomena and on the nature of emptiness can these habits be abandoned, and only through an understanding of the ultimate nature of things can the fruit of actions done through abandonment-that is, liberation from the suffering of cyclic existence-be attained. The promissory note metaphor is at work here as well. The idea is that one cannot simply cancel a promis- sory note on one's own without paying the debt. One must do something more substantial to discharge one's obligation to one's creditor.
16. If abandonment occurred through abandoning, and If action were destroyed through transformation, The destruction of action, etc.,
And other errors would arise.
If one thought that one could just resolve to abandon attach- ment and delusion and succeed, that would be to treat attachm'ent and attached action as trivia! entities-even as illusory in the full sense. Just as when one sees a mirage, one can, knowing that it is a mirage, stop seeing it as water. That is possible for illusory things, but not so for empirically real ones. lt takes effort to see an actual puddle as empty-not of conventional water, but of nonconven- tional inherent existence-and it takes effort to stop reifying hab- its. Again, though this is articulated in defense of the opponent's view, this is a sophisticated opponent, and Niigiirjuna in fact agrees with much of this.
17. From all these actions in a realm,
Whether similar or dissimilar, At the moment oi birth
Only one will arise.
One performs countless various actions in one's life. And the conftuence of the karmie consequences of all of them, on this view, are realized in the beginning of a single individual at the moment
￼238 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
of rebirth (the one who arises). This comment is, of course, most directly about rebirth and the mechanism of karma in transmigra- tion. Here is a way to understand that explicit point: The mecha- nism by which karma operates in rebirth is not that each individual action in a continuum designated as an individual remains perma- nently in place or leaves a substantial trace that lies dormant until it produces its consequence. This is indeed how karma is often conceived by substantialist Buddhist schools. Rather, each mo- ment of such a continuum, including the moment of rebirth, is a consequence, through the mechanism of dependent arising, of all of the previous moments of that continuum (and, of course, of much else besides). Those karmie consequences are, as it were, "summed up" in the total state of the individual at birth.
But of course the implications of this are more         and concem every moment of any life. They can hence be made inde- pendently of any discussion of transmigration, though of course they help to demystify that Buddhist doctrine, at least as it is conceived in Mahayana philosophy. The point is this: Every mo- ment of our lives represents the causal consequences of, inter alia, all of our prior actions. No action "lies dormant" waiting for its consequences to emerge. Nor does any action somehow become "canceled" when some salient consequence is noticed. There is no accounting kept, and no debit and credit system, either from the causal or the       point of view in the continuum of human action and experience. Rather, at each moment we are the total conse- quence of what we have done and of what we have experienced. And the only sense in which some past action may determine some future reward is one in which that past action, as well as other conditions, have determined a state now !hat, together with other future conditions, will determine that reward. Mutatis mutandis, of course, for negative consequences. This sober empiricist ac- count of these matters forms the basis for Mahayana       theory and its account of the nature of soteriological practice.
18. In this visible world,
All actions of the two kinds,
Each comprising action and the unexpired separately.. Will remain while ripening.
￼Examination of Actions and Their Fruits 239
But here the opponent slides over inio the substantialism thai Niigiirjuna will criticize. For although he has characterized actions as impermanent, he has retained the seed-and-sprout metaphor thai has the actions identifiable over time and, hence, as having an independent existence and identity. Moreover, he suggests, their consequences are determinate in time, delimited by death or nirv31,1a:
19. That fruit, if extinction or death Occurs, ceases.
Regarding this, a distinction between the stainless And the stained is drawn.
Niigiirjuna now mounts a reply against all of these positions collectively:
20. Emptiness and                  Cyclic existence and nonpermanence:
That action is nonexpiring
Is taught by the Buddha.
All phenomena, including action, its result, and the connection between them, will come out to be empty of inherent existence, yet conventionally real; they will be part of cyclic existence, but will be impermanent. This is not surprising. But Niigiirjuna also says thai no action expires (retaining the promissory note metaphor). Obvi- ously, he cannot mean thai actions are permanent. Rather, we should understand this to assert two related theses: First, it indi- cates thai the consequences of actions do not cease at some point. All actions have ramifications into the indefinite future, due to dependent arising. Second, actions themselves, being empty of inherent existence are not entities capable of passing out of exis- tence, when passing out of existence is interpreted to mean the cessation entirely of something thai once existed inherently. Since actions are not inherently existent, they are not suitable bases for inherent cessation. And this resolves the       apparent paradox: The tension between the assertion that nothing is permanent and that all action is nonexpiring. All phenomena are indeed imperma-
￼240 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
nent, but thai entails both that they do not inherently cease and
thai their effects are indefinite in scope.
21. Because action does not arise, It is seen to be without essence.
Because it is not arisen,
It         that it is nonexpiring.
This verse emphasizes the second reading of the thesis of the nonexpiration of action and echoes the arguments from Chapter VII.
22. If action bad an essence,
It would, without doubt, be etemal.
Action would be uncreated.
Because there can be no creation of what is etemal.
Moreover, Nagarjuna reminds us, again drawing heavily on the arguments reviewed and redeployed in Chapter VII, things with essences don't arise and cease, and can't be related causally to other things. I f action existed inherently, it couldn't be initiated. So, if one were trying to preserve the reality of action and karma against the analysis in terms of emptiness (because one viewed thai analysis as undermining their genuine existence), it would be pointless to de- fend the existence of action and karma as inherent existence.
23. If an action were uncreated,
Fear would arise of encountering something not done. And the error of not preserving
One's vows would arise.
Nagarjuna here and in XV!!: 24 draws some of the       conse- quences of the nihilistic view of action thai seems to follow from the conditions set on its existence by the reificationist: Actions would not come into being through agency and so would have no regular relation to any agents. And so one might find oneself experiencing the consequences of some action one had not performed, or find that it was, in some sense, one's own action. One would not take action seriously as one's owo responsibility and would not worry
￼Examination ofACtions and Their Fruits 241
about       infractions. Monks and nuns would break their vows. Since morality depends on a distinction between morally positive and morally negative acts, if there were no actions, or if actions could not be thought of as initiated by their agents, there would be no morality. From another perspective, the preservation of vows would be an impossibility anyway since preserving the vows requires taking action, which would be impossible if action were uncreated.
24. All conventions would then
Be contradicted. without doubt.
It would be impossible to draw a distinction Between virtue and evil.
Moreover, Niigiirjuna argues in the next verse, if actions bad essences, they could not cease, and if their karmie consequences had essences since they would need no conditions to arise, they would just keep arising:
25. Whatever is mature would mature Time and time again.
If there were essence. this would follow, Because action would remain in place.
26. While this action has affliction as its nature This affliction is not real in itself.
lf afftiction is not in        
How can action be real in itself?
Moreover, Niigiirjuna continues, afflicted action is, for the oppo- nent, done essentially in affl.iction. But given thai affliction has already been shown to be empty in the chapter on suffering (XII), how could it serve as an essence for action? ·
27. Action and afftiction
Are taught to be the conditions that produce bodies. If action and afftiction
Are empty, what would one say about bodies'?
The opponent replies, however, that action and affliction are referred to in sutras as the causes of different kinds of rebirth and
￼242 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
of different characteristics in rebirths. And since beings are indeed rebom and do indeed have characteristics, how, from the stand- point of a Buddhist view of rebirth, could empty actions and empty karmie consequences explain this?
28. Obstructed by ignorance,
And consumed by passion, the experiencer Is neither different from the agent
Nor identical with it.
Niigarjuna focuses in his reply on the nature of the individual who is the putative agent of these actions and experiencer of their consequences. The present objection rests on the presupposition thai they exist inherently. Thai is why the problem arises about how empty actions and empty karmie links could be sufficient to link their properties. So Niigiirjuna emphasizes thai neither an analysis in terms of inherent identity nor one in terms of inherent difference between agent and action will suffice. Both presup- poses, incoherently, the inherent existence and hence the posses- sion of an essence, of each term in the putative relation. But this of course recalls the problem posed near the end of Chapter I: How can actual effects arise from empty cond.itions? And Niigarjuna's reply echoes the reply developed there:
29. Since this action
ls not arisen from a condition,
Nor arisen causelessly,
It follows that there is no agent.
Since the action does not arise inherently, it lacks inherent exis- tence. Since, as per the discussion of agent and action in Chapter VIII, empty actions entail empty agents, there is no inherently existing agent of the kind presupposed by the objector. But the objector continues:
30. lf there is no action and agent, Where couId the fruit of action be?
Without a fruit,
Where is there an experiencer?
￼Examination of Actions and Their Fruits 243
That is, if we deny the reality of the action and the agent, we seem to deny the reality of the consequences of the action and, hence, the experiencer, whether "without understanding and con- sumed by passion" or not. But Niigiirjuna's view is not that these things are non-existent, as he emphasized in XVII: 20-only thai they are empty. So it does follow that the consequences are empty-but that does not entail in any way thai they are nonexis- tent. And it follows thai the consequence and the karmie link are empty. From this it follows that the reborn individual whose exis- tence and characteristics are determined by this causa! sequence is also empty of inherent existence. And if so, there is no problem about how his/her genesis is dependent upon an empty sequence. Niigiirjuna introduces an analogy to explain this situation:
31. Just as the teacher, by magie, Makes a magical           and
By that illusion
Another          is created,
32. In that way are an agent and his aCtion: The agent is like the illusion.

Is like the illusion's illusion.
That is, we can understand the entire sequence of agent, ac- tion, consequences of action, and arising of new agent, whether within a single lifetime or-in the context of Buddhist ontology and doctrine-across lifetimes, as an entirely empty sequence with entirely empty stages. But thai does not prevent its being perceived, or its reality for those who participate therein.
33. Afftictions, actions, bodies, Agents, and fruits are
Like a city of Gandharvas and Like a mirage or a dream.
Again, it is important to emphasize that emptiness, rather than being a kind of nonactuality contrasting with empirical reality, is in fact the very condition of empirical reality and hence the only kind
￼244 THE. TEXT AND COMMENTARY
of genuine actuality. Mirages and dreams are actual phenomena, which actually appear and which have consequences. But that does not mean that they appear to us in a nondeceptive way. Mirages are not water and do not quench thirst, and dream-elephants carry no loads. By analogy, sa111siira, action, karmie link, and conse- quence, Niigiirjuna argues, are real empirical phenomena, but are empty of anything more than conventional existence. While they may appear to exist inherently, either as persistent phenomena, as processes or elements of processes, or as abstract phenomena-as per the various opposing views considered in this chapter-they do not so exist. For to exist in those ways would in fact be incoherent. This analysis hence does not entail the nonexistence of agent and action, except from the ultimate point of view. Rather it explains how it is possible for them to exist at all.
￼Chapter XVIII .Examination of Self and Entities
A good deal of the confusion Niigiirjuna diagnoses in the previous two chapters concems the presupposition that the self, as an af- fticted being capable of liberation from           musi be thought of as an inherently real entity. In this chapter, therefore, Niigiir- juna tums to an examination of the self, per se, apart from its relation to such things as perception, action, suffering, afftiction, and so forth, as he has examined it in      chapters.
1. If the self were the aggregates,
It would have arising and ceasing (as properties).
If it were different from the aggregates.
It would not have the characteristics of the aggregates.
lf there is an inherently existent self, it musi either be identical to or different from the aggregates. The aggregates are the more basie components into which the individual divides upon analysis. In standard Buddhist analysis, they include the physical body, sensation, perception, dispositions, and consciousness or cogni- tion. lt is important to note, though, that this particular analysis has no deep philosophical significance. lt reftects an essentially          psychological theory about the best explanatory frame- work to use in comprehending human behavior and the most useful way for a Buddhist practitioner to attend to his/her experi-
￼246 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
ence. As we have seen already, the aggregates are themselves empty, and as much Buddhist psychology emphasizes, they, too, are subject to further decomposition. But Niigarjuna's argument proceeds independently of any particular decomposition. No mat- ter how one analyzes the human being, if we are to posil over and above the components into which if divides an inherently existent self, thai self musi be either identical to or different from those components. (This argument, by the way, appears in virtually the same form in On Man by Sextus Empiricus.)
But if the self is identical to the aggregates, it will be constantly changing, constantly arising and ceasing, since the aggregates are constantly arising and ceasing. This is so whether one takes the self to be identical to some one of the aggregates or to the whole collection of the aggregates. If, on the other hand, one takes the self to be distinct from the aggregates, the relation between them becomes completely mysterious; the self becomes unknowable, and the fate of the aggregates becomes irrelevant to ihe fale of the self. This is because the only objects ever given to us in introspec- tion are the aggregates (a familiar Humean insight), and the self we presumably care about is one we know. And it would be a bit bizarre to suggest thai whatever happens to my mind, body, mem- ory, sensory experience, and so forth, is independent ofwhat hap- pens to me.
One musi, of course, keep in mind thai this destructive dilemma depends upon the attempt to identify a single inherently existent self and does not undermine the possibility of a conventionally identified self posited on the basis of the aggregates. So what Nagarjuna is emphatically not doing is arguing thai there are no aggregates in any sense or thai there are no persons, agents, sub- jects, and so forth. The hypothesis for reductio is that over and above (or below and beneath) any composite of phenomena collec- tively denoted by "I" or by a proper name, there is a single substan- tial entity thai is the referent of such a term.
But, the proponent of the inherently existent self asks, what is the bearer of the self's properties and the thing that possesses those aggregates? The first half of XVIII: 2 raises this question. The second half begins Nagarjuna's reply, which occupies the re- mainder of the chapter and constitutes a             portion of his
￼Examination ofSelfand Entities 247 positive view on the nature of self from the standpoint of ontology
and soteriology:
2. If there were no self,
Where would the self's (properties) be?
From the pacification of the self and what belongs to it. 01.1e abstains from grasping onto "I" and "mine."
Nagarjuna replies that once one stops trying to posil an indepen- dent self, the problem posed simply vanishes. That is, the worry about the possessor of the aggregates and properties of the self occurs only given that one conceives of them as properties and aggregates that are essentially of something. The insight is a bit abstract, but it is the same one that Hume was after in the Fig argument in the Treatise.92 Much of the motivation for positing a substantial self is the intuition that since its properties and compo- nents exist, they must exist somewhere-that there musi be a sub- stratum in which they inhere. But once we give up that conception of what it is for a property or a component to exist (as Niigarjuna has argued that we must in Chapters V, VI, and IX above), the drive to posil a substratum vanishes. And when the drive to posil the substratum vanishes, we simply, Nagarjuna urges, think of the aggregates and properties as associated aggregates and properties, not as my aggregates and properties.
3. One who does not grasp onto "I" and "mine," That one does not exist.
One who does not grasp onto "I" and "mine." He does not perceive.
These are corelative. When one stops grasping the aggregates and the self as independent entities or as the possessions of inde- pendent entities, one recognizes one's own lack of inherent exis- tence. One also recognizes the lack of inherent existence of the aggregates, as in the case of perception. This is not to say that one ceases conventionally to exist or that one goes blind-rather it is
92. See Hume (1975), pp. 235-39.
￼248 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
that one comes to understand one's own existence and that of other entities in the context of emptiness and, hence, to regard that existence as necessarily relational and conventional.
The relation between the second and third verses of this chapter is also important from the standpoint of the relation between theory and practice, philosophy and soteriology: Niigiirjuna empha- sizes the two-way streets in this neighborhood. Understanding emp- tiness leads one to grasp less, to become more detached. Relaxing one's tendency to grasp leads to a realization of emptiness. Philoso- phy, meditation, and the practice of the       virtues that issue in the relaxation of grasping are conceived from this vantage point as necessarily mutually supportive.
4. When views of ·'I" and "mine" are extinguished, Whether with respect to the internat or external, The appropriator ceases.
This having ceased, birth ceases.
When one completely relinquishes the view of entities and the self as inherently existent and when all habits of reification have been eliminated, Niigiirjuna urges, liberation from cyclic existence and suffering have been achieved. Niigiirjuna defers the precise characterization of nirvii(la to the chapter devoted to its examina- tion and that devoted to the examination of the status of the Tathiigata (XXV and XXII, respectively).
5. Action and misery having ceased, there is nirviil)a. Action and misery come from conceptual thought. This comes from mental fabrication.
Fabrication ceases through emptiness.
The diagnosis, though, of the predicament of sarpsiira and the corresponding prescription are elear: Grasping, contaminated ac- tion, and suffering are rooted in delusion, and this delusion comes from cognitive error. The root delusion-the fundamental cogni- tive error-is the confusion of        conventional existence with inherent existence. The realization of emptiness eliminates that fabrication of essence, which eliminates grasping, contaminated action, and its pernicious consequences.
￼Examinarion ofSelfand Entities 249
6. That there is a self has been taught, And the doctrine of no-self,
By the buddhas, as well as the
Doctrine of neither self nor nonself.
There are many di,scussions of the way to think about the self in the Buddhist canon. For those who are nihilistic about the self (such as contemporary eliminative materialists or classical Indian Ciirviikas), it is important to explain the conventional reality of the self. For those who tend to reify the self, the doctrine of no-self is taught, that is, the doctrine of the emptiness of the self. But, Niigiirjuna claims, as a preamble to the next verse, there is a deeper view of the matter-a doctrine of neither self nor nonself.
Thai doctrine is closely tied to that of the emptiness of            Both the terms "self" and "no-self" together with any conceptions thai can be associated with them, Niigiirjuna claims, are conven- tional designations. They may each be soteriologically and analyti- cally useful antidotes to extreme metaphysical views and to the disturbances those views occasion. But to neither corresponds an entity-neither a thing thai we could ever !ind on analysis and identify with the self, nor a thing or state that we could identify with no-self. The terms and the properties they designate are themselves empty, despite the fact that they are used to designate emptiness. To say neither self nor no-self is, from this perspective, not to shrug one's shoulders in indecision but to recognize that while each of these is a useful characterization of the situation for some purposes, neither can be understood as correctly ascribing a property to an independently existent entity. And if they cannot be understood in this way, what are we really saying?
7. What language expresses is nonexistent. The sphere of thought is nonexistent. Unarisen and unceased, like nirvii.l)a
Is the nature· of things.
This insight is developed further in this verse. Here Nagiirjuna be- gins to move towards his famous and surprising identification of nir- Viil)a with samsara, and of emptiness with conventional reality. This
￼250 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
ifientification of what in earlier Buddhism were regarded as wholly different from one another and this characterization of the mundane in terms heretofore reserved for the putatively transcendent are among Nagarjuna's most radical and original moves and are cen- tral to the development of a distinctively Miihiiyana outlook. In the first two lines, he reiterates thai there are no actual convention- independent entities thai correspond to the ostensible referring terms or predicates in our language. But, he argues, from the empti- ness of things, it follows thai they never either arise or cease. This does not mean thai they are permanent, of course. Rather it means thai while arising and ceasing and consequent impermanence are features of all conventional phenomena and are among the features
, thai make them empty, from the ultimate point of view, as was argued in Chapter VII, there is no ultimate basis for arising and ceasing. But if nirvao;ia is liberation from cyclic existence and hence from arising and ceasing, it follows that, from the ultimate stand- point, all things in saQlsiira are actually just as they are in nirvao;ia.
8. Everything is real and is not real,
Both real and not real,
Neither real nor not real.
This is Lord Buddha's teaching.
This is the positive tetralemma regarding existence. Everything is conventionally real. Everything is ultimately unreal (thai is, not unreal in just any sense, but unreal when seen from the ultimate standpoint). Everything has both characteristics-that is, every- thing is both conventionally real and ultimately unreal. Nothing is ultimately real or completely nonexistent. That is, everything is neither real in one sense nor not-real in another sense."·"
93. My reading contrasts with that of lnada (1970, p. 113), who argues that here Nagarjuna intends to deny these four possibilities. See also Sprung (1979) and Wood (1994) for interpretations that fail to appreciate completely the posi· tive tetralemma and its role in Nagarjuna's enterprise (though to be sure Wood takes note of the positive mood of this instance). Ruegg (Im) interprets this verse as suggesting gradations of progressively more sophisticated teachings- progressing from a mundane analysis of existence to a teaching of emptiness, to a teaching of their compatibility, to an indication of the inability of predication. Ng (1993), pp. 93-97, agrees. While such a purport would be something with
￼Examination ofSelfand Entities 251
Interestingly, the tetralemma can also be asserted in a negative form with some of the same force: Nothing is real (ultimately). Nothing is not-real (everything has a kind of reality). Nothing is both real and not-real (in the same sense-that would be contradic- tory). Nothing is neither real nor not-real (the law of the excluded middle). Both forms of the tetralemma are found in this text. See XXII: 11."·„
9. Not dependent on another, peaceful and Not fabricated by mental fabrication,
Not thought, without distinctions,
That is the character of reality (that-ness).
That is, independent of conceptual imputation there are no ob- jects, no identities, and so, no distinctions. But of course, as Kant would agree, there is no way thai we can think such a reality.
which N3girjuna would agree, it seems out of place in this discussion. Wood, on the other hand, takes this verse to indicate that straightforward contradictions (existence and nonexistence) follow from the supposition that anything exists at all, in any way, and, hence, to form part of a nihilistic analysis. While such a reading would make sense if one only attended to this chapter. taken in the context of the work as a whole, and especially Chapter XXIV, that nihilistic reading is very hard to sustain.
94. That is, of course, everything that is conventionally real in the first place. Santa Claus is not among the objects of analysis here.
95. lt is interesting to note-and we will return to this point in XXII below- that Nigirjuna typically resorts to positive forms of the tetralemma wben emphasiz- ing claims about conventional phenomena and to negative forms when emphasizing the impossibility of the literal assertion of ultimate truths. Ng (1993), pp. 99-105, notices this point as well.
96. Herc I take issue with philosophers such as Sprung (1979), who argue that the tetralemma is insigniticant for Midhyamika thought. Indeed, as I indicate in several places in this commentary, it is, both in its positive and negative moods, often an indispensable analytic tooJ. lt is indeed ••used as a means of investigation" (p. 7) here and elsewhere in the text. And as I argue here and below it is often quite useful. Sprung may be lcd to this conclusion by the fact that he overlooks the contrast between positive and negative tetralemmas, focusing exclusively on the latter. Moreover, he confuses its logical structure. See Ruegg (1977) and Matilal (tm) for divergent but each interesting and helpful investigations into the struc- ture of the tetralemma, as well as Wood (1994) for what I regard as a serious misunderstanding of the tetralemma and of its deployment in Madhyarnika philoso- pby (see esp. pp. 64-77).
￼252 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Nonetheless, Niigarjuna argues (and Kant stili agrees), we musi see that that is the ultimate truth about things, though it might in its nature be inexpressible and inconceivable."'
10. Whatever comes into being dependent on another Is not identical to thai thing.
Nor is it different from it.
Therefore it is neither nonexistent in time nor permanent.
Here Niigarjuna recapitulates a brief analysis of what it is for a phenomenon to be dependently arisen. But in the context of the deeper understanding of emptiness and of the relation between the ultimate and the conventional developed in this chapter, a deeper reading of this verse is in order: Our attention is called to the fact that the analysis of dependency developed here-and conse- quently of the conventional reality and ultimate nonexistence of the dependent-is at the same time a correct conventional charac- terization of the nature of phenomena and an ostention of the fact
97. His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in oral remarks (Columbia University, 1994), notes that "'whenever we examine physical, mental, or abstract entities, we find as a result of a reductive analysis nothing but their unfindability. So you can't really speak coherently of identity or of entities. This is the fundamental teaching of MAdhyamika." See also Nagao (1989), pp. 67-68, for useful remarks on XVIII: 7- 9. But this interpretation can be carried too far, with the consequence that Niigiirjuna is seen as a thoroughgoing Kantian absolutist, regarding the ultimate truth. Murti (1985) endorses just sucha view:
Origination, decay, etc ... are imagined by the uninformed; they are specula· tions indulged in by the ignorant. The real is utterly devoid         of these and other conceptual constructions; it is transcendent to thought and can be realised only in nondual knowledge-prajlid or Intuition, which is the Abso· lute itself. . . . The distinction between two truths, Paramdrtha and Samvrti, is emphasised... .
. . . It as generally accepted [by Nagarjuna and his followers] that the real is Absolute, at once Transcendent of Empirical Determinations and Immanent [in] Phenomena as the innennost essence. (p. xi [caj&gt;italization in original])
Kalupahana (1986), adopts another extreme reading, arguing that this verse in fact says nothing about the character of reality, but rather "the means by which a conception of truth is arrived at." He argues that it merely admonishes one to be independent in one's thinking, unbiased and calm in one's philosophical inquiry. It is hard to see how this reading could be justified apart from a strong antecedent commitment to seeing N8g8rjuna as a pragmatist.
￼Examination ofSelfand Entities 253 that it is only a conventional designation of a nature that must
remain uncharacterizable.98
li. By the buddhas, patrons of the world, This immortal truth is taught:
Without identity, without distinction;
Not non-existent in time, not permanent.
That is, this doctrine itself is also empty. lt is conventionally real, ultimately nonexistent, dependent, impermanent, and has a nature in itself that can never be characterized. The fina! verse is an admonishment to meditate seriously on this argument. For by understanding clearly the nature of the self and of the entities to which it is related, Ni!garjuna believes that one can attain bud- dhahood. That is why he emphasizes that with a correct view, even without a teacher or a buddha to instruct one, a patient meditator can attain his/her own awakening.
12. When the fully enlightened ones do not appear, And when the disciples have disappeared,
The wisdom of the self-enlightened ones
Will arise completely without a teacher.
98. Kalupahana(1986)readsthese     versesverydifferently,ashavingnoth- ing to do with the ultimate truth, but rather as suggesting that freedom from          "d&lt;?eS not necessarily mean the absence of a subject-object discrimination. It means the absence of any discrimination based upon one's likes and dislikes, one's obsessions" (p. 59). It is, however, very hard to square this reading of XVIII: IO, 11 with any defensible reading of XVIII: 8, 9.
￼ChapterXIX Examination of Time
Another response to the attack on the reality of action and its conse- quences might to be argue that, nonetheless, the time in which action and its consequences are realized must be real. Niigiirjuna in this chapter argues that time cannot be conceived of as an entity existing independently of tempora! phenomena, but must itself be regarded as a set of relations among them. His arguments are closely akin to those of Zeno, Sextus, and McTaggart.
1. If the present and the future Depend on the past,
Then the present and the future Would have existed in the past.
Niigiirjuna's method is to divide time into the past, the present, and the future and then to argue that none of these can be said to inherently exist. In these first two verses, he considers one horn of an implicit dilemma: The present and the future either depend upon the past or they do not. In these two verses he considers the possibility that they do depend upon the past. But if they depend upon it in any sense that could plausibly guarantee their inherent            they must somehow emerge from it as a basis. If so, he argues, they must have existed in the past. For if they did not, then we would have the situation where when the time on which they
￼Examination of Time 255
ostensibly depend exists they do not exist, or a situation where at the time they exist that on which they ostensibly depend does not exist. We would then either have the situation in which the ostensi- bly dependent exists, but in the absence of that on which it de- pends, or in which the necessary condition exists, but without that of which it is the condition.
This raises two difficulties, one general and one specific to the case at hand: First, by the arguments developed concerning the tempora! relations between causes and their effects in Chapters I and VII, we have two incoherent situations from the standpoint of anyone who considers the causa! relation or its relata to be inher- ently existent. There must be a real relation between the cause and the effect in which the effect is contained potentially in the cause, and this would unfortunately entail the past existence of the pres- ent and the future. But second, there is a little regress to be devel- oped. For if the present and the future depend upon the past, they must succeed or be simultaneous with it. But they must succeed or be simultaneous with it in time. That requires a super-time in which the parts of time are related, and so on, ad infinitum.
2. If the present and the future Did not exist there,
How could the present and the future Be dependent upon it?
That is, if we deny that the present and the future existed poten- tially in      past and were somehow coexistent with it, there is no way to understand the mechanics of the dependency relation. By the time the present comes around, the past isn't around to give rise to it. And when the past was around, the present didn't occur.
3. I f they are not dependent upon the past, Neither of the two would be established. Therefore neither the present
Nor the future would exist.
If, on the other hand, one argued that the parts of time are independent, there would be no sense in which they would be
￼256 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
determinately ordered and in which they would be part of the same time. Time is by definition an ordering of events in which moments stand in determinate relations to one another, in virtue of which the location of any moment depends on the location of all of the others. The present is the present only because it is poised within the past and the future. If it were not, it would not be the present. So either the present is in the past, in .which case it is nonexistent, or it is independent of the past and the future, in which case it is nonexistent.
4. By the same method,
The other two divisions-past and future,
Upper, !ower, middle, etc., Unity, etc„ should be understood.
Thai is, we can            this argument about the dependency of the future and present, whose narrow purpose is to demonstrate the nonexistence of the present, to demonstrate the nonexistence of the past and future as            existent entities. Moreover, Niigiirjuna notes, this argument          mutatis mutandis, to spa- tial relations.
5. A nonstatic time is not grasped.
Nothing one could grasp as
Stationary time exists.
If time is not grasped, how is it known?
This is a second destructive          Time, if il exists as an entity, is either stationary or changing. To say thai it is changing is incoherent; we would need to posil a super-time in which thai change occurs. But to say thai it is static is incoherent as       Thai suggests thai past, present, and future coexist. So there is no coher- ent conception of time as an entity.
6. If time depends on an entity,
Then without an entity how could time exist? There is no existent entity.
So how can time exist?
￼Examlnation of Time 257
Finally, Niigiirjuna argues, we cannot suppose thai time exists as. one entity dependent on some other as its ground if we want time to exist inherently. This is because, in the previous arguments in the text, we have already argued thai none of the entities thai exist in time. are inherently existenL So none would form a suitable ontological basis for an inherently existent time.
But this       verse is double-edged, and its positive reading contains Niigiirjuna's positive account of the nature of time. Niigiirjuna points out thai with no entities to be temporally related, there is no time. Thai is, the only mode of existence thai time has is as a set of relations among empirical phenomena. Apart from those phenomena and those relations, there is no time.99 But thai means thai, given the lack of inherent existence of phenomena, there can be no inherent existence of time. Time is thus merely a dependent set of relations, not an entity in its own right, and certainly not the inherently existent vessel of existence il might appear to be.
99. This insight is foundational for OOgen's later analysis of Uji, or being-time.
￼ChapterXX Examination of Combination
This chapter examines the possibility that, while no effect could be inherently dependent upon any single cause, it might be that the correct understanding of dependent arising and the thoroughgoing interdependence of phenomena that Niigiirjuna urges involves the inherent dependence of any phenomenon on the combination of all of its conditions. Thus, while every phenomenon would, as Niigiirjuna has been arguing, be completely dependent on all oth- ers, this dependence itself would be inherently existent. Much of the argument is a reprise of arguments that we have seen already, particularly in Chapters I and VII. But the tempora! analysis of Chapter XIX is also in evidence.

The effect is in the combination,
How could it arise from the combination?
lf, arising from the combination of Causes and conditions,
The effect is not in the combination,
How could it arise from the combination?
In the opening verses, Niigiirjuna sets up the destructive di- lemma that frames the first part of this chapter: Either the effect is
￼Examination of Combination 259
already present in the combination on which it is supposed by the reificationist to inherently depend or it is not. lf it is, he will argue, there is no sense in which it really arises from them at all. lf not, on the other hand, he will argue that there is no sense in which what- ever dependence there is could be inherent dependence. Niigiir- juna alternates in the subsequent verses between these alterna- tives, developing a number of difficulties for each.
3. If the effect is in the combination Of causes and conditions,
Then it should be grasped in the combination. But it is not grasped in the combination.
First, suppose that the effect already exists somehow in the com- bination of phenomena on which it depends. Then in grasping- that is, in conceiving or perceiving-that collection, we should, ipso facto, grasp the effect. But we do not. Consider the set of conditions of a match lighting. There is the presence of sulphur, friction, oxygen, and so forth. But neither in virtue of conceiving of these things nor in virtue of seeing them do we see fire.
4. Ifthe effect is' not in the combination Of causes and conditions,
Then        causes and conditions
Would be like noncauses and nonconditions.
On the other hand, Niigiirjuna argues, if the proponent of inher- ently existent dependence argues that the effect is not present in the combination, he would have to say that there is no difference between actual conditions of an effect and an arbitrary collection of phenomena with no relation at all to it. Because the very point of this analysis is to explain how a particular set of conditions determines an effect. For Niigiirjuna, as we should be able to see by recalling his treatment of dependent origination and the rela- tion between conditions and their effects in Chapter I, this is no problem: There is simply no general metaphysical answer to such a question for a Miidhyamika philosopher. A collection of conditions determines its effect simply because when those conditions are
￼260 THE TEXT AND COMME.NTARY
present, that effect        That fact may in tum be            explicable by other              But there is no independent foun- dation for the network of regularities itself. However, for the sub- stantialist there must be some analysis of the            of condi- tions itself that answers the question regarding how that            has the power to produce that effect. And the answer the opponent proposes is that it does so because the effect is inherently present in some sense in that            
5. Jf the cause, in having its effect, Ceased to have its causa! status,
There would be two kinds of cause:
With and without causal status.
At this point, Niigiirjuna tums to the temporal relation between the effect, the cause, and the combination of conditions that to- gether with the primary cause of the effect      about the effect. The position that he is worrying about is this: Effects depend upon particular causes, but those causes need the cooperation of support- ing conditions in order to be efficacious. The familiar example in this context is that of the seed and the sprout. The seed, according to the proponent of such a position, causes the sprout, but only if there is soil, water, air, and so forth, to support it. Nagiirjuna then complains that on this view the word "cause" is being used equivo-        In one sense it is used to refer to things-the        causes-that        don't cause anything. In the other sense, it is used to refer to those that        have causal status-namely, the entire assemblage of conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the        of the effect.
6. I f the cause, not yet having Produced its effect, ceased,
Then having arisen from a ceased cause,
The effect would be without a cause.
But, he urges, if we want to assert that the cause, instead of changing from a cause to a noncause, simply ceases at.the moment when it produces its effect, we stili have a problem. Because by the
￼Examination of Combination 261
time the effect emerges, the cause·will have vanished, and the effect will then have emerged without a cause and so will be a causeless eifect.
7. lf the effect were to      Simultaneously with the             Theo the produced and the producer Would      simultaneously.
Thming now to the entire collection as determinative of the effect, Niigiirjuna points out that the effect cannot be simultaneous with the occurrence of a collection of its conditions for all of the reasons that he has advanced previously against the simultaneity of causes and their effects.
8. lf the effect were to      Prior to the combination,
Then, without causes and conditions,
The effect would      causelessly.
But neither, of course, can the effect arise before the conditions are met since the effect would then       spontaneously, and this possibility has been refuted earlier.
9. If, the cause having ceased, the effect
Were a complete transfonnation of the cause, Then a previously arisen cause
Would      again.
Niigiirjuna now responds to the following possible reply: The effect in question is not an entity distinct from the cause or the collection of conditions that serve as its ground. Therefore these questions about the temporal relations between events involving distinct entities do not       The sprout is not distinct from the seed, but is merely a complete transformation of it. But, Niigiir- juna argues, it is also not possible to characterize the effect as a simple change of nature of a single entity that was the cause before the transformation. For then we would have to say that the cause
￼262 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
remains in existence after the effect arises and so would have to keep producing the same effect over and over again.
This argument might seem not to have much bite. After all, one might think, the altemative being proposed seems quite like Nagiirjuna's own view that we should not think of causes and their effects as distinct entities. But this would be wrong. This argument succeeds because the opponent denies the distinctness in entity between cause and effect by positing an identity in essence and by appealing to that essence to explain the causal potentia! of the cause. If the essence of the entity is what determines its causal potential, then if that essence remains, the potential should remain as well. If the essence does not remain, then the language oftrans- formation must be abandoned: If the essence remains, and the language of transformation is retained at an accidental level, the       that there is an essential causal principle must be rejected.
10. How can a cause, having ceased and dissolved, Give rise to a produced effect?
How can a cause joined with its effect produce it If they persist together?
Nagarjuna now retums to the temporal trilemma. As he has argued before, just as a cause cannot follow or be simultaneous with its effect, the precedence of cause over effect is problematic as well. For when there is a cause, there is no effect. When there is an effect, there is no cause. And ifwe appeal to temporal overlap, we inherit all of the problems with precedence, simultaneity, and col- lections. In introducing the idea of a cause being "joined" with its effect ('brei-ba), Nagarjuna is introducing a putative causal link into the discussion. One who proposes simultaneity or temporal         of cause with effect might be doing so in order to make possible such a link. But Nagarjuna here claims that positing that link does not overcome the temporal difficulties he has presented.
In XX: 11-15, Nagarjuna summarizes the results of these argu- ments. Causes, whether single or composite, cannot precede, coin- cide with, or follow their effects; causes cannot produce their ef- fects in isolation, nor can collections of causes inherently produce their effects:
￼Examinalion of Combination 263
11. Moreover. if not joined with its cause, What effect can be made to arise? Neither seen nor unseen by causes
Are effects produced.
Here Niigiirjuna returns to his critique of the idea of a causa( nexus. He points out that though that idea has been shown to be incoherent, it is the only way that one can make sense of a real causa( link or of inherently existent production. So in its absence, we cannot make sense of the production of an effect by its cause. In the last two lines, Niigiirjuna makes use of the strange metaphor of a cause seeing its effect to denote this link (thongs-ba). •oo This is clearly a metaphor for this link, suggesting that whether it is forged by contiguity or by some other means at a distance, it will be explanatorily impotent.
12. There is never a simultaneouS connection
Of a past effect
With a past, a nonarisen, Or an arisen cause.
13. There is never a simultaneous connection Of a an arisen effect
With a past, a nonarisen, Or an arisen cause.
14. There is never a simultanCous connection Of a nonarisen effect
With a past, a nonarisen, Or an arisen cause.
15. Without connecting,
How can a cause produce an effect?
Where there is connection,
How can a cause produce an effect?
At this point, Niigarjuna turns directly to the connection between emptiness and the dependence of effects on collections of condi-
100. Jnada, with some philosophical justification, translates this as "projected." But I see linie lexical merit in that choice.
￼264 THE TEXT ANO COMMENTARY
tions. The opponent now asks how a cause or collection of causes
that does not contain the effect in any way can produce that effect:
16. Jf the cause is empty of an effect, How can it produce an effect?
Jf the cause is not empty of an effect, How can it produce an effect?
Nagarjuna, echoing the argument of Chapter I, replies that only if cause and effect are empty can production be understood. The next verse explains this in more detail:
17. A nonempty effect does not arise. The nonempty would not cease.
This nonempty would be
The nonceased and the nonarisen.
If the effect were nonempty, as the opponent presupposes in wondering how the effect could be produced from empty causes, then since the inherently existent depends on nothing, the effect would be unproduced and would never cease. But there are no such things. So the putative problem case, the nonempty effect of empty causes, is not even possible.
18. How can the empty arise?
How can the empty cease?
The empty will hence also
Be the nonceased and nonarisen.
Nagarjuna emphasizes here the double edge of the ontology of emptiness. Even though it is in virtue of the fact that conventional entities are constantly arising and ceasing that they are empty, their emptiness entails that they do not, from the ultimate standpoint, arise, cease, or abide at all. This is an eloquent statement of the interpenetration of the ultimate and the conventional truths: The very ground on the basis of which emptiness is asserted is denied reality through the understanding of emptiness itself. The empti- ness of phenomena is, after all, asserted on the basis of their momentary impermanence. But that imperrnanence and the very
￼Examination ofCombination 265
existence of the impermanent objects asserted to be empty is not even present from the ultimate standpoint. Yet thai, rather than constituting a self-refutation, constitutes a self-confirmation. For if anything were apparent from the ultimate standpoint, that phe- nomenon would be nonempty. li is the absence of any such phenomenon-not its presence-that confirms the analysis and thai prevents il from lapsing into a view, in the· pernicious sense.101
19. For cause and effect to be identical Is not tenable.
For cause and effect to be different Is not tenable.
Niigiirjuna here returns to the business of.mobilizing destructive dilemmas against the view thai any dependence of effects on        cations of conditions could be inherently existent. The argument in XX: 20 is based on the dichotomy of identity or difference of cause and effect and is drawn from Chapter I:
20. lf cause and effect were identical,
Produced and producer would be identical. lf cause and effect were different,
Cause and noncause would be alike.
For the relation at issue in this chapter to be inherently existent, the            of conditions would have either to be identical in nature or different in nature from the effect. If identical, we would have the absurd consequence thai the effect was self-caused. But if the effect is         different in essence, we have no explanation of how thai            of conditions produced thai effect.
21. lf an effect bad entitibood,
What could have caused it to arise?
lf an effect bad no entitibood, What could have caused it to arise?
This attack on the inherent status of the          between condi- tions and effects focuses on arising itself. The effect must either
10( See the discussion of XX.VII: 30 for more on this point.
￼266 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
bave entitihood or not. If it does, its being caused to arise is self- contradictory. If not, though, from the ultimate standpoint it does not arise. It would follow from either that there is no inherently existent arising and, so, no inherent production from a collection of conditions. The next verse makes this same point from the side of the collection. If the effect produced is not inherently produced, the collection does not inherently produce it. If not, it is not an inherently productive collection:
22. If something is not producing an effect, It is not tenable to attribute           
If it is not         to attribute            Then of what will the effect be?
23. l f the combination
Of causes and conditions
Is not self-produced,
How does it produce an effect?
The ground of an inberently existent relation of production must be inherently existent. But then it could depend on nothing else. It would have to be self-produced. But tbis is not claimed for the collection of conditions or the relation between them and the effect by the opponent here. It couldn't be. For the whole point of mov- ing to a collection is to avoid the problems of production from a single cause. But collections depend upon their parts and upon the causes of those parts. So no such collection can be self-produced. So, while Nagiirjuna can certainly grant that effects are dependent upon collections of conditions, it cannot be that !bose collections or that dependence exist inherently»
24. Therefore, not made by combination,
And not without a combination can the effect arise. If there is no effect,
Where can there be a combination of conditions?
Combinations of conditions, just like individual conditions and just like their effects, can only be conceived of as empty of inher- ent existence.
￼ChapterXXI
Examination of Becoming and Destruction
In this chapter, Niigiirjuna examines the phenomenon of momen- tary impermanence. At this point in the dialectic, one might suggest that since the emptiness of phenomena derives directly from their decomposition into momentary time-slices and from the fact that they are constantly coming into existence and being destroyed, that process of momentary arising and destruction it- self ought to be real in the strong sense. Niigiirjuna, by way of completing the discussion of the nature of conventional phenom- ena, demonstrates the emptiness of even arising and destruction themselves as a prelude to the       section of the text, that discussing the nature of the ultimate and its relation to conven- tional reality.
1. Destruction does not occur without becoming. It does not occur together with it.
Becoming does not occur without destruction. It does not occur together with it.
This first verse announces the       stage in the argument to be developed. Niigiirjuna will show that destruction and becoming are both mutually incompatible and that they are mutually entailing. It
￼268 THE TEXT 'AND COMMENTARY
will then follow that if they are inherently existent, they have
contradictory properties.
2. How could tbere be destruction Without becoming?
How could there be death without birth?
There is no              without becoming.
Niigiirjuna argues that, absent something coming into being, there is no sense in which it can be destroyed. So destruction presupposes becoming.
3. How couId destruction and becoming
Occur simultaneously?
Death and birth
Do not occur                
But they cannot exist simultaneously. For then the same entity
would have contradictory properties.
4. How could there be becoming Without destruction?
For impermanence
Is never absent from entities.
Since all phendmena are impermanent, as has been forcefully argued in earlier chapters, anything that comes into existence passes out of existence.
5. How could destruction
And becoming occur simultaneously? Just as birth and death
Do not occur simultaneously.
6. How, when things cannot
Be established as existing,
With, or apart from one another) Can tbey be established at all?
￼Examination of Becoming and Destruction 269
This is the argument to this stage: Becoming and destruction are mutually contradictory. So they cannot be properties of the same thing at the same time. But everything that is coming into existence is at a stage in a process thai culminates in its destruction. So everything that is becoming is at the same time being destroyed. Everything thai is being destroyed is in a later stage of a process that earlier resulted in its coming into existence and, indeed, is coming to exist in some other form. So everything that is being destroyed is also becoming. So becoming and destruction cannot coexist, but cannot exist apart. Hence they cannot exist indepen- dently at all.
7. There is no becoming of the disappeared. There is no becoming ofthe nondisappeared. There is no destruction of the disappeared. There is no destruction of the nondisappeared.
This verse offers an epigrammatic summary of the previous argu- ment: All phenomena, when analyzed closely, resolve into ephem- eral moments, constantly disappearing to be succeeded by later stages of what are conventionally identified as the same objects. So everything thai has ever existed has disappeared. Such a thing cannot be coming inio existence. But no nondisappeared thing ever comes into existence. For as soon as it exists, it disappears.- Similarly such things cannot be in the process of destruction. But nothing thai is not ephemeral is destroyed either. Given this ephemeral nature of phenomena, establishing becoming and de- struction as distinct, independent processes is impossible. This claim is made directly in XXI: 8:
8. When no entities exist,
There is no becoming or destruction. Without becoming and destruction, There are no existent entities.
In the next verse, Niigiirjuna connects this point directly to emptiness and to inherent existence, painting out both that empti- ness precludes the inherent establishment of becoming and de-
￼270 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
struction and that positing inherently existent phenomena would
do no better:
9. It is not tenable for the empty To become or to be destroyed.
It is not tenable for the nonempty To become or to be destroyed.
The empty cannot come to be or be destroyed simply because there is no basis for the predication. With no entities, there is nothing to be brought into existence or to be destroyed. But if we posit nonempty phenomena, their independence and consequent permanence preclude their coming to be or destruction.
10. It is not tenable
Thai destruction and bccoming arc identical. It is not tenablc
That destruction and becoming are different.
They cannot be identical because they are contradictory predi- cates. But every destruction is a coming to be and vice versa. Hence when conceived of inherently, they can be neither identical nor different; when conceived of inherently, they cannot exist:
11. I f you think you sec both Destruction and becoming,
Then you see destruction and becoming Through impaired vision.
In the next two verses, Nagarjuna addresses coming to be. He points out that if it is conceived of as       existent then it rnust satisfy at least one of the alternatives represented in cach of the following two tetralemmas. But il cannot:
12. An entity does not arise from an entity.
An entity does not arise from a nonentity.
A nonentity does not arise from a nonentity. A nonentity does not arise from an entity.
￼Examination of Becoming and Destruction 271
The first alternative is precluded because inherently existent and distinct phenomena, Niigiirjuna has argued, cannot be related de- pendently. The second is precluded because that would involve production from nothing. The third would fail to count as inher- ently existent production, and from the standpoint of one who posits inherent existence as a guarantor of reality, would only amount to the production of the imaginary in any case. The       alternative again would not amount to real production of anything.
13. An entity does not arise from itself. It is not arisen from another.
It is not arisen from itself and another. How can it be arisen?
This verse simply recapitulates the argument of Chapter I in the service of the conclusion thai arising cannot be conceived of as an independent phenomenon. Nagarjuna now draws more         conclusions regarding the implication of the view thai existence amounts to inherent existence for the extreme positions. He devel- ops in the next two verses a nice reductio ad absurdum:
14. lf one accepts the existence of entities,
Permanence and the view of complete nonexistence follow. For these entities
Must be both permanent and impermanent.
If one thinks thai any existent entity musi exist inherently, then one is forced simultaneously to embrace the extremes of nihilism and reification. One musi reify because any existent musi be treated as inherently existent and hence permanent. But upon observing the impermanence of phenomena, one will be driven to nihilism since their impermanence would entail their lack of inher- ent existence and hence their complete nonexistence. An oppo- nent, however, can be imagined to reply as follows:
15. lf one accepts the existence of entities Nonexistence and permanence will not follow. Cyclic existence is the continuous
Becoming and destruction of causes and effects.
￼272 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
If Nagarjuna is correct, this objection goes, there is a constant becoming and destruction of causally related phenomena. This, after all, is the heart of the Miidhyamika analysis of phenomenal reality. But if that is so, these phenomena that are becoming and being destroyed must exist. Otherwise, what comes into and passes out of existence? It is these entities, this opponent argues, that we must posit. And from positing such entities, neither their complete nonexistence nor their permanence follows. For they are by definition impermanently existent. Niigiirjuna replies in the next verse:
16. If cyclic existence is the continuous
Becoming and destruction of causes and effects, Then from the nonarising of the destroyed Follows the nonexistence of cause.
Given the pervasiveness of dependent arising, the impermanence of all causes and effects, and the emptiness of the relation of depen- dence itself, causes and effects themselves must be regarded as noninherently existent. For the person who equates existence with inherent existence, this forces the denial of the very becoming and destruction he has posited as the only inherently existent phenom- ena. The point against the objection asserted in the previous verse is this: The very fact thai constant becoming and destruction character- izes reality entails that at no point can anything be identified as an entity in the robust sense-a thing with a nature that persists over time. The very phenomena the opponent wants to posil as existent in order to make sense of the series of becoming and destruction are, when that series is taken seriously, themselves nonexistent. But the kind of full existence the opponent feels compelled to posil is in any case not only impossible given this situation, but unnecessary as well. Nagarjuna now turns to the soteriological implications ofthis view of becoming, destruction, and entitihood:
17. If entities exist with entitihood,
Then their nonexistence would make no sense.
But at the time of nirv3.l).a,
Cyclic existence ceases completely, having been pacified.
￼Examination of Becoming and Destruction 273
If we thought that anything had inherent· existence-whether entities, processes, or arising and its determinants-that could not possibly cease in nirval)a. So this view would render Buddhist soteriology incoherent and is therefore, since il purports to be a view of the nature of cyclic existence by contras! with nirvana, untenable.
The next three verses sum up the results of this investigation regarding the possibility of conceiving of empirical reality as consist- ing of a series of momentary phenomena, each one of which gives rise to the next through an inherently real nexus of destruction and becoming. The structure of the argument is by now familiar:
18. I! the       one has ceased,
The existence of a first one makes no sense. If the       one has not ceased,
The existence of a first one makes no sense.
lf the momentary phenomenon prior to a present momentary phenomenon has ceased prior to the arising of the present one, there is no basis for thai arising. But if it has not ceased, then its destruction cannot be an occasion for the arising of the subsequent event. So the prior momentary phenomenon can neither have ceased nor not ceased.
19. lfwhen the       one was ceasing. Then the first was arising,
The one ceasing would be one. The one arising would be another.
Thai is, if we say thai the cessation of the previous momentary phenomenon is simultaneous with the arising of its successor, then being simultaneous but distinct, the two phenomena are separable and hence independent. If so, there is no basis for positing any connection between them. This is yet another application of the principle of the independence of separable phenomena.
20. lf,           the one arising
And the one ceasing were the same,
Then whoever is dying with the aggregates Is also arising.
￼274 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Finally, we don't want to identify arising and ceasing, claiming that they are the same phenomenon, since they are by definition contraries. It \\iOUld be tantamount, Nagarjuna claims, to saying that a person who is dying is simultaneously being bom. From the standpoint of one who wants to posit arising and destruction as the two complementary inherently existent bases of cyclic existence, il would hardly do to say thai they are one and the same thing.
21. Since the series of cyclic existence is not evident In the three times,
If it is not in the three times,
How could there be a series of cyclic existence?
And finally, if we cannot conceive of the domain of conventional phenomena as inherently existent in time, there is no sense in suggesting that it has some kind of transtemporal existence. The object of analysis here is the conventional world we inhabit. So, Nagarjuna concludes, we cannot, upon analysis, resolve the do- main of conventional phenomena into a series of constantly aris- ing, constantly ceasing, yet individually inherently existent momen- tary phenomena, connected to one another and characterized by inherently real arising and ceasing. As this target ontology was among the subtlest of the pre-Madhyamika views of the nature of reality, dependent arising, and impermanence (and is indeed not by any means a relic within Theravada Buddhism) and as it repre- sents a plausible interpretation of fundamental Buddhist tenets, this refutation is an appropriate close to the portion of the text concerned directly with the analysis of the fundamental structure of conventional reality. With this in hand, Nagarjuna turris in the       six chapters to topics concemed with the nature of ultimate reality: buddhahood, prominent incorrect views about the ulti- mate, the Four Noble Truths and emptiness, nirvar:ia, and the twelve limbs of dependent origination.
￼Chapter XXII Examination of the Tathagata
This is the first of the fina! set of chapters in the text, all of which deal directly with topics concerning the ultimate truth and its rela- tion to the conventional. The doctrine of the two truths, central to all Mahiiyana Buddhist philosophy, is most explicitly enunciated in Chapter XXIV. But it is present as a pervasive theme in the text. There is a conventional world of dependently arisen objects with properties, of selves and their properties and relations. And in that world there is conventional truth: Snow is white. Grass is green. Individual humans are distinct from one another and from their materia! possessions. But there is also an ultimate truth about this world: It is empty (of inherent existence). None of these objects or persons exists from its own side (independently of convention). From the ultimate point of view there are no individual objects or relations between them. Just how these two truths are connected, and how we are to understand them simultaneously, is the central problem of Madhyamika epistemology and metaphysics, and from the standpoint of Madhyamika, a satisfactory solution is essential for Buddhist soteriological practice and ethics as well.
But discourse about the ultimate is perilous in a number of ways. First, and most obviously, there is the ever-present danger of talk- ing sheer nonsense. For the ultimate truth is, in some sense, ineffa- ble in thai all words and their referents .are by definition conven- tional. The dualities generated by the use of terms thai denote
￼276 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
individuals or classes as distinct from others or from their comple- ments are unavoidable in discourse and nonexistent in the ulti- mate. So one must be very careful to kick away all ladders promptly. At the same time, there are things thai one can say without lapsing into nonsense, by way of ostention, even from the bottom rungs.
But the other grave danger is this: By distinguishing the conven- tional from the ultimate, it is tempting to disparage the former in contrast to the latter, developing a sort of theory of one truth and one falsehood. This is done if one reifies the entities associated with the ultimate, such as emptiness or impermanence, or the Four Noble Truths, or the Buddha. Then one treats these as real, intrin- sically existent phenomena. The conventional then becomes the world of illusion. It is to combat this tendency to treat the conven- tional world as illusory through treating such apparently transcen- dent entities as inherently existent that Niigiirjuna develops these fina! chapters. Perhaps the most obvious candidate for reification in a Buddhist context is the Buddha himself, and that is where Niigarjuna begins:
I. Neither the aggregates, nor different !rom the aggregates, The aggregates are not in him, nor is he in the-aggregates. The Tathiigata does not possess the aggregates.
What is the Tathagata?102
This form of analytic demonstration of the nonexistence of the self through an analysis of its possible relationship to the aggre- gates, often referred to as the "fivefold analysis," is developed with great elegance by Candrakirti in Miidhyamakilvatdra. Niigiirjuna proposes four of live possible relations the self bears to the aggre- gates in this first verse, and the fifth is considered in the next two verses. Here the self in question is the Buddha's self, but the analysis is perfectly general as a refutation of any assertion of an inherently existent personal self. Thai self cannot be the aggre-

gates for two reasons: First, the self posited is meant to be unitary, and the aggregates are plural. Second, the aggregates are con- stantly undergoing change, while the self that is posited is meant to endure as a single entity.
But the self can't be differerit from the aggregates either. For anything that happens to the aggregates happens to the self, and vice versa. If I hurt my body, I hurt myself. If you lose your vision, you become blind. And in the present case, buddhahood is presum- ably attained by a purification of the aggregates through practice. If the aggregates were entirely different Crom the self. it is not elear how purifying them would lead the practicioner to buddhahood.
The self cannot stand outside the aggregates as a basis for them, for if we strip away all of the aggregates, there is nothing left as an independent support. But nor is the self somehow contained in the aggregates as a hidden core, and for the same reason. When we strip away all of the aggregates in thought, nothing remains of the self.
2. If the Buddha depended on the aggregates,
He would not exist through an essence.
Not existing through an essence,
How could he exist through otherness-essence?
The fifth possibility is that the self, in this case the Buddha's self, is distinct from but dependent upon the aggregates. But from the standpoint of positing an inherently existent Buddha this is unsatis- factory. For if the Buddha were dependent, he would lack an essence and would be empty. And the situation can't be saved by suggesting that he has an essence through a relation to another since that presupposes essential difference, which presupposes that both the Buddha and the aggregates on which he is supposed to depend have individual essences: This is reinforced in the first two lines of the next verse:
3. Whatever is dependent on another entity, Its seltbood -is not appropriate. . It is not tenable that what lacks a self Could he a Tathiigata.

￼278 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The reifier in the last two lines of this verse and in the next asks how it is possible that a real Buddha could lack a self. What then would be the thing thai practiced, that became enlightened and that preached the Dharma?
4. If there is no essence,
How could there be otherness·essence?
Without possessing essence or otherness·essence, What is the Tathligata?
5. I f without depending on the aggregates There were a Tathligata,
Then now he would be depending on them. Therefore he would exist through dependence.
That is, on the opponent's view, e.ven if the Buddha bad no dependence on the aggregates prior to attaining Buddhahood, in order to act as a Buddha, he must depend upon his consciousness, perception, body, and so forth. So ifwe suppose thai the Buddha is now inherently existent and omniscient and compassionate and so forth, we must assume that he exists through dependence on his aggregates in some sense.
6. Inasmuch as there is no Tath3gata
Dependent upon the aggregates,
How could something that is not dependent Come to be so?
We already know that the Buddha as a sentient being in samsara, prior to entering nirviiQa, could not exist dependent on the aggregates. This is a straightforward consequence of the argu- ment for the nonexistence of a self distinct from the aggregates and from the fact that in order to depend upon the aggregates, the self would need to be distinct from them. And so, Niigiirjuna points out, it would be odd to think that an entity not dependent upon the aggregates in samsara would come to be so upon entering nirviiQa. It would, of course, be particularly odd for someone defending the target of this critique. Anyone holding such a position would hardly be expected to ascribe to the Buddha a more dependent status in nirviiQa than in samsara.

7. There is no appropriation. There is no appropriator.
Without appropriation
How can there be a Tath3gata?
The appropriation here is the appropriation of aggregates as one's owo. Without it, there can be no sense of individual identity. Since the opponent is positing the Tathiigata as an inherently exis- tent individual, he must hold him to have his owo aggregates.
8. Having been sought in the fivefold way,
What, being neither identical nor different,
Can be thought to be the Tathagata Through grasping?
But, as we have seen in the first two verses of this chapter, there is no way that the Buddha can be thought of as inherently existent in relation to those aggregates. So we can't divorce the Buddha from the aggregates. Nor can we understand the Buddha as inher- ently existing given that he musi have aggregates.
9. Whatever grasping the re is Does not exist through essence.
And when something does not exist through itself,
lt can never exist through otherness-essence.
So the Buddha does not exist inherently in virtue of his owo essence. Nor does he exist inherently in virtue of some property of his aggregates or, for that matter, in virtue of anything else that is other, such as an inherently existent buddha-nature or state of nirviiQ.a.
10. Tuus grasping and grasper
Together are empty in every respect.
How can an empty Tathagata Be known through the empty?
So we must conceive of the Buddha .and of all that pertains to him as empty of inherent existence. But the question then arises:
￼280 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
What can we say or know of such an empty Buddha? This is a fundamental question not only with regard to our knowledge of the nature of enlightenment, but also with regard to our ability to say anything coherent about emptiness itself and empty phenomena.
11. "Empty" should not be asserted. "Nonempty" should not be asserted.
Neither both nor neither should be asserted. They are only used nominally.
This negative tetralemma is a crucial verse for understanding the relation between discourse on the conventional level and the under- standing of emptiness or the ultimate truth. Nagiirjuna has been urging all along that ultimately all things are empty. lt would be easy to interpret bim to mean that from the ultimate standpoint, we can say of phenomena that they are empty. But here he quite deliber- ately undermines that interpretation, claiming instead that nothing can be literally said of things from sucha standpoint. For ultimately there is no entity of which emptiness or nonemptiness can be predi- cated. Nor can we say that things are neither empty nor nonempty. For that would contradict the fact that from the standpoint of one using conventional language and cognition, it is correct to character- ize phenomena as empty. The central claim in this verse is that all assertion, to the extent that it is true at all, is at best nominally true. Discourse about the ultimate character of things is not exempt from this generalization. Predication always requires an entity of which the predicate can be true; and the emptiness of phenomena guaran- tees that from the ultimate standpoint, there areno phenomena to be empty. The language is hence at best only ostensive.103 The next verse generalizes this observation:
103. See Padhye (1988), esp. pp. 79-82, for further useful disC1:Jssion of the import of this and other negative tetralemmas for N3g8.rjuna's philosophy of language. Padh-ye correctly emphasizes that Nagarjuna and his Pr8saogika- M8.dhyamika followers reject any kind of Fregean or other realistic semantics that would require the independent existence of properties, including emptiness or nonemptiness, or of individuals, as the semantic values of predicates or subject terms, respectively, arguing for a more pragmatic view of linguistic meaning. Hun· tington (1989) emphasizes this point as well. I discuss this issue at greater length in connection with the interpretation of Vigrahavyiivartani in Garfield (unpublished).

How can the tetralemma of finite, infinite. etc., Be true of the peaceful?
13. One who grasps the view that the Tathagata exists, Having seized the Buddha,
Constructs conceptual fabrications About one who has achieved nirvaJJa.
Here Niigarjuna returns to the problem of ascribing inherent existence to the Buddha in the context of thinking about phenom- ena from the ultimate standpoint. The problem is that, as Nagar- juna has argued above, the only grounds for asserting the inherent existence of the Buddha would be on the grounds of the inherent existence of the aggregates and some view about the relations of the self to the aggregates. And we have seen that to be untenable. Moreover, since upon achieving nirval)a, on most Buddhist doc- trine, one ceases to identify a self and aggregates, it would follow thai upon achieving nirviil)a one would cease to exist. This is dou- bly problematic. On the one hand, it forces one to see nirviil)a as complete annihilation, which doesn't make it look quite so attrac- tive. On the other hand, it forces the conclusion thai the Buddha is either not in nirviil)a (since he exists), which is paradoxical in that buddhahood should guarantee nirviil)a, or that he both exists (as a genuine buddha) and does not exist (in virtue of being in nirviil)a), which is contradictory.
14. Since he is by nature empty,
The thought that the Buddha
Exists or does not exist
After nirvaoa is not appropriate.
Nagarjuna here draws on the results of XXII: 11, 12 to point out that one can evade all of these paradoxes by simply rejecting the language of existence and nonexistence when these are read inher- ently. Empty things exist conventionally; but about their ultimate status, nothing can be literally said. Of course we can say that the Buddha is empty and, hence, neither really existent nor completely
￼282 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
nonexistent. But that, Niigiirjuna is arguing in this chapter, can be      understood in a        negative sense. The          nature of things is perhaps shown by it, to use a Wittgensteinian metaphor, but cannot be said in this             
15. Those who develop mental fabrications with regard to the Buddha,
Who has gone beyond all fabrications,
As a consequence of those cognitive fabrications,
Fail to see the Tathagata.
To see buddhahood for what it is-to see things as a buddha sees them-one must see things               of the categories that determine an          of entities and a dichotomy of exis- tence and nonexistence. That this is               to us, for Niigiirjuna,      indicates the fact that we are trapped in conven-        reality through the force of the          of reification. But we can, through using the Miidhyamika            come to see the nature of our predicament, the possibility of transcending it, and even the nature of that transcendepce. That, however, requires us to             the                character of            imputation.
16. Whatever is the essence of the Tathagata, That is the essence of the world.
The Tath3gata has no essence. The world is without essence.
This               verse emphasizes again the      of any funda-        nature of entities. Emptiness is the       nature of all things, from rocks to dogs to human beings to buddhas.1°'This fact entails, for Mahayiina philosophers, the possibility of any sentient being to be fundamentally transformed-to attain enlightenment.

But this is so, paradoxically, because ultimately there is no funda- mental transformation, because there is nothing to transform. In Chapters XXIV and XXV below, we will see the dramatic conse- quences of this line of reasoning.
￼Chapter XXII! Examination of Errors
This ehapter eontinues the investigation of the relation between eyclie existenee and nirvii1.1a by asking whether the fundamental defilements and the four basie eognitive errors, whieh according to orthodox Buddhist doetrine bind us to salJlsiira, themselves inher- ently exist and by asking how it is possible to abandon them and enter nirvii1.1a. The fundamental defilements are desire, hatred, and confusion: the desire for things thai are not desirable, the aversion to things to whieh il is not reasonable to be averse, confu- sion about the actual nature of entities. These, according to most strains of Buddhist philosophy, are the bases of afHicted action, which in turn leads to further grasping and error. The four basie errors or erroneous philosophical theses are: (l)There is a perma" nent self among the five personal aggregates. (2) There is real happiness in salJlsiira. (3) The body is pure-that is, thai it is a real source of happiness. (4) There is a permanent self distinet from the aggregates.
If these defilements and errors were inherent properties of the self, thai might serve as a ground for the inherent existenee of SalJlsiira and its phenomena, to the extent thai salJlsiira is.grounded in these phenomena. Moreover, though, if these defilements and errors were inherently existent, it is hard to see how nirvii1.1a is possible sinee it requires their elimination. But on the other hand, if these defilements do not exist, il is hard to see why there is
￼Examination of Errors 285
sa!Jlsiira at all and why we are not already in nirviil)a. And if they are merely illusions, why isn't the distinction between sa!Jlsiira and nirviil)a merely an illusion; why isn't suffering merely an illusion? In short, why isn't illusion merely an illusion? This chapter is de- voted to answering these fundamental questions in Buddhist soteriological theory.
1. Desire, hatred, and confusion all Arise from thought, it is said.
They all depend on
The pleasant, the unpleasant, and errors.
Without reifying entities, a cognitive operation, there is no basis for desire for those entities, of aversion from them, and no confu- sion regarding their mode of existence. Seeing things as pleasant or unpleasant in themselves depends upon confusing our desire or aversion with respect to them with properties they have in them- selves. The desire and aversion in tum depend upon our attribut- ing pleasantness and unpleasantness to the entities. lt is a tight and vicious circle of attribution and emotional reaction, all depending upon reification.
2. Since whatever depends on the pleasant and the unpleasant Does not exist through an essence,
The defilements Do not really exist.
But it follows from this that the defilements, in virtue of depend- ing on these attributions and upon our relation to pleasant and unpleasant things, all of which are themselves empty, are empty of inherent existence. Indeed, they are not only dependently arisen, but depend upon things or features of those things already shown to be empty.
3. The self's existence or nonexistence
Has in no way been established.
Without that, how could the defilements' Existence or nonexistence be established?
￼286 THE TEXT     COMMENTARY
Moreover, the defilements are meant to be defilements of the self. But the self-the putative basis of those defilements-cannot exist inherently. So the defilements, being attributes of an empty phenomenon, cannot be nonempty. The following verse reiterates that position:
4. The defilements are somebody's.
But that one has not been established. Without that possessor,
The             are nobody's.
In_ the first line, an interlocutor points out that if there are defile- ments at all there must be somebody whose defilements they are. Niigiirjuna replies that we have already shown that there is no subject for personal attributes in the many discussions of the rela- tion between the self and its states previous to this (Chapters Ili, IV, VIII, IX, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, and XVIII). So whatever analysis of defilement we develop, it will have to be one according to which they presuppose no defiled individual.
5. View the defilements as you view yourself: They are not in the defiled in the fivefold way. View the defiled as you view your self:
It is not in the defilements in the fivefold way.
This verse recalls and applies the fivefold analysis of the self developed in the previous chapter to the analysis of the defile- ments and the defiled. They are not identical to the aggregates, completely different from the aggregates, present as a basis of the aggregates, contained in the aggregates as a core, or separate from or dependent upon the aggregates. The arguments conceming the relation of the self to the aggregates can simply be applied directly either to the defilements or to the defiled.
6. The pleasant, the unpleasant, and the errors Do not exist through essence.
Which pleasant, unpleasant, and errors
couId the defilements depend upon?
￼Examination of Errors 287
Nor can we say that the defilements are inherently existent in virtue of being grouncied in inherently existent pleasantness, un- pleasantness, and error. While it is true that the latter are the basis of the defilements, they, too, Nagarjuna will argue, are empty.
7. Form, sound, taste, touch,
Smell, and concepts of things: These six Are thought of as the foundation of Desire, hatred, and confusion.
8. Form, sound, taste, touch,
       and concepts of things: These six
Should be seen as only like a city of the Gandharvas and Like a mirage or a dream.
Sensory contact, perception, and cognition are the causal grounds of the defilements. But as was shown in Chapter III, they are empty as well.
9. How could the
Pleasant and unpleasant arise
In those that are like an illusory person And like a reflection?
Since the self and others have been demonstrated to be empty and pleasantness and unpleasantness must be properties of one, the other, or both, there can be no inherently existent basis for pleasantness or unpleasantness. They themselves must also there- fore be empty.
10. We say that the unpleasant
Is dependent upon the pleasant,
Since without depending on the pleasant there is none.
It follows that the pleasant is not tenable.
11. We say that the pleasant
Is dependent upon the unpleasant.
Without the unpleasant there wouldn't be any. It follows that the unpleasant is not tenable.
Moreover, pleasant and unpleasant are mutually dependent. Nagarjuna here claims that "pleasant" and "unpleasant" are not
￼288 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
absolute but rather comparative terms and, hence, essentially in- terdefined. lf this is so, then since their referents depend upon each other for their satisfaction of these descriptions, neither prop'. erty can exist inherently.
12. Where there is no pleasant,
How can there be desire? Where there is no unpleasant, How can there be anger?
And since these are the bases for desire and anger, desire and anger, arising from empty phenomena, must themselves be seen as empty.
13. If to grasp onto the view
"The impermanent is permanent" were an error, Since in emptiness there is nothing impermanent, How could that grasping be an error?
This verse adverts to·the first of the four principal errors-that one of the five aggregates, typically consciousness, is perrnanent. The reason that it is held by Buddhists to be an error, of course, is that all of the aggregates are analyzed as imperrnanent-hence the forrnulation in the second line, whose definite description must be read de re. But, Niigiirjuna argues, since there are no actual imper- manent phenomena from the ultimate point of view, this can't actually be seen as the false attribution of a property (perrnanence) to a real entity that actually has a contrary property (imperma- nence). The point here is simply that in calling this an error, one must be very careful not to commit a corresponding error-to suggest that calling the imperrnanent impermanent constitutes the assertion of an ultimate truth or of the presupposition of the ulti- mate reality of impermanent phenomena. That is at best a true conventional assertion that indicates the ultimate nature of things. This claim is made explicit in XXIII: 14:
14. If to grasp onto the view
„The impermanent is permanent" were an error,
Why isn't grasping onto the view
"In emptiness there is nothing impermanent" an error?
￼Examination of Errors 289
15. Thai by means of which there is grasping, and the grasping, And the grasper, and all thai is grasped:
All are being relieved.
It follows thai there is no grasping.
The argument above addresses the first and fourth of the princi- pal errors directly. This verse hints at the generalization of this argument to the other two. If there is no permanent self, there is nothing to do the grasping that generates the view that there is happiness in sarpsiira or to grasp onto the body. Since all of these errors are rooted in grasping and since any inherently existent grasping would depend on an inherently existent grasper, these errors cannot be inherently existent. The next two verses empha- size the nonexistence of both the error and the one in error from the ultimate standpoint:
16. Il there is no grasping
Whether erroneous or otherwise, Who will come to be in error? Who will have no error?
17. Error does not develop
In one who is in error. Error does not        
In one who is not in error.
And, Niigiirjuna points out, following the same patiem used in the analysis of motion and redeployed numerous times in the text, we can't think of error developing in one in whom error is arising. If the error is already arising in bim, an independent error cannot be developing there. Moreover, as error develops, the person in whom it is developing changes, and no substrate for the develop- ment of error can be found. It follows that really existent error, conceive&lt;l of as an independent phenomenon, is no more real than its putative subject (but of course no less real, either):
18. Error does not develop
In one in whom error is arising. In whom does error develop? Examine this on your own!
￼290 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The next two verses mobilize a by now familiar         argu- ment against inherent           specifically against the inherent existence of error: Either error has arisen or it hasn't. If it has, it depends on something and so is not inherently existent. If it has not, it has not come to be and so is either nonexistent or unex· plained. Moreover, if error is to be conceived as inherently exis- tent, it must arise from one of the four possible sources: self, other, both, or neither. And all four possibilities have been refuted for inherently existent entities in the         case in Chapter I:
19. lf error is not arisen,
How could it come to exist?
lf error has not arisen, How could one be in error?
20. Since an entity does not arise from itself,
Nor from another,
Nor from another and from itself, How could one be in error?
Nagarjuna now returns to the objects of the four principal errors and points out that if they existed inherently, as the proponent of inherently existent error would have it, they would be       exis- tent and, hence,.would be nondeceptive ultimate truths.
21. I f the self and the pure,
The permanent and the blissful existed, The self, the pure, the permanent,
And the blissful would not be deceptive.
But why is the opponent forced to think of the objects of inher- ently existent error as inherently existent? That is, of course, an obviously incoherent position. But the view characterized as an error must have some ontological basis. And the self that is puta- tively in error has already been ruled out. So the only remaining possibility is that the error is the perception of an inherently real but at the same time deceptive object: a real but nonexistent ob- ject. lt is this that Niigiirjuna claims is incoherent. Error then can
￼Examination ·of Errors 291
neither be an objectless but inherently existent mental phenome- non,10•nor can it be a subjectless perception of an inherently real but nonexistent object. So in no way can error be grounded in anything substantial.
22. If the self and the pure,
The permanent and the blissful did not exist, The nonself, the impure, the permanent, And suffering would not exist.
But at this point Nagarjuna draws quite a surprising conclusion. These observations apply not only to the putative objects of the errors, but also to those of Buddhist doctrine, at least when it is given a substantialist reading. Continuing his critique of the idea that assertions made from the standpoint of conventional truth about the ultimate nature of things are literally true from the ulti- mate standpoint, Nagarjuna points out that the fact that there is no permanent self, no happiness in salJlsiira, and no pure body does not entail that an impermanent self, suffering, or an impure body are in any way inherently existent. That is, the objects of correct conventional understanding are no more inherently existent than those of incorrect understanding. The truth of even Nagarjuna's own philosophical theory is not grounded in its reference to inde- pendently existent, substantially real entities.
23. Thus, through the cessation of error Ignorance ceases.
When ignorance ceases
The compounded phenomena, etc., cease.
When all error is abandoned and we see the world aright, we are no longer ignorant of the true nature of things. But this is not because we then apprehend things and their true nature. Rather we apprehend that there are no things, per se, and that those posited from our side have no nature to understand.
106. For one thing, NAgArjuna has argued that there is no inherently existent mind in which it could be located. For another, the idea of error, per se, though not error about anything, is patently incoherent.
￼292 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
24. If someone's defilements Existed through his essence,
How could they be relinquished? Who could relinquish the existent?
Nagarjuna reminds the s.ubstantialist at the end that if the defile- ments or errors were inherent in the person and, hence, were part of his/her essence, they would be perrnanent and, hence, could not be relinquished. This would constitute a direct rejection of one of the most fundamental tenets of the Buddhist outlook-the possibil- ity of liberation.
25. If someone's defilements
Did not exist through his essence,
How could they be relinquished?
Who could relinquish the nonexistent?
On the other hand, he reminds those who may have followed the argument this far, but who may be tempted either to nihilism about the defilements or to the subtler error of asserting that their depen- dence and emptiness is literally their ultimate nature, that the defilements must be conventionally real in order to be relin- quished. They are, from the ultimate point of view, completely unreal; from that point of view, there is no relinquishment of any- thing at all. This, as we shall see, is an important harbinger of the doctrines of the identity of the two truths and of sa!Jlsara and         to be developed in the next two chapters, which represent the climax of the text.
￼Chapter XXIV
Examination of the Four Noble Truths
While Chapter XXIV ostensibly concerns the Four Buddhist Truths and the way they are to be understood from the vantage point of emptiness, it is really about the nature of emptiness itself and about the relation between emptiness and conventional reality. As such, it is the philosophical heart of Mulamadhyamakaktlrikii. The first six verses of the chapter (XXIV: 1-6) present a reply to Niigiirjuna's doctrine of emptiness by an opponent charging the doctrine with nihilism. The next eight verses (XXIV: 7-14) are primarily rhetorical, castigating the opponent for his misunder- standing of Miidhyamika. The positive philosophical work begins with XXIV: 15. From this point Niigii.rjuna offers a theory of the relationship between emptiness, dependent origination, and con- vention and argues not only that these three can be understood as corelative, but that if conventional things (or            itself) were nonempty, the very nihilism with which the reificationist oppo- nent charges Miidhyamika would ensue. This tactic of arguing not only against each extreme but of arguing that the contradictory extremes are in fact mutually entailing is, as we have seen in earlier chapters, a dialectical trademark of Niigiirjuna's philosophical method. In this chapter, it is deployed with exceptional elegance and acuity.
￼294 THE TEXT     COMMENTARY
The opponent opens the chapter by claiming that if the entire phenomenal world were empty, nothing would in fact exist, a con- clusion absurd on its face and, more importantly, contradictory to fundamental Buddhist tenets such as the Four Noble Truths (XXIV: l-6) as well as to conventional wisdom:
1. If all of this is empty, Neither arising, nor ceasing, Then for you, it follows that
The Four Noble Trutbs do not exist.
The Four Noble Truths are: (1) All life in cyclic existence is suffer- ing. (2) There is a cause of this suffering, namely, craving caused by ignorance. (3) There is a release from suffering. (4) The path to that release is the eightfold Buddhist path of right view, right concentra- tion, right mindfulness, right speech, right effort, right action, right morality, right livelihood. The Four Noble Truths, preached by the Buddha in his first teaching after gaining enlightenment, are the fundamental philosophical tenets of Buddhism. If it were a conse- quence of Niigiirjuna's doctrine of emptiness that the Four Noble Truths were in fact false or, more radically, nonexistent, that would constitute in this philosophical context an immediate refutation of the position. This is not because these assertions are articles of faith, in the sense ofrevealed doctrine, but because anyone arguing within this framework has accepted the arguments for them.
2. If the Four Noble Truths do not exist, Then knowledge, abandonment,
Meditation, and manifestation
Will be completely impossible.
Once we reject the Four Noble Truths, the essential ingredients of Buddhist practice become unintelligible. Knowledge of the ulti- mate nature of things becomes impossible since all of the knowl- edge gained in this tradition is knowledge of things that accords with the truths. Abandonment of error and craving, and eventually of cyclic existence, becomes unintelligible without the context of the analysis .contained in the truths. Meditation loses its point. The
￼Examination ofthe Four Noble Truths 295
eightfold path becomes a path to nowhere. This all amounts to a rejection of the entire Buddhist Dharma, one of the three jewels in which Buddhists take refuge, the others being the Buddha107 and the Sangha, or the spiritual community of Buddhist practicioners and teachers.
3. If these things do not exist, The four fruits will not arise.
Without the four fruits, there will be no attainers of the fruits. Nor will there be the faithful.
4. lf so, the spiritual community will not exist.
Nor will the eight kinds of person.
If the Four Noble Truths do not exist, There will be no true Dharma.
These verses highlight these implications regarding the Dharma, but also point out that the rejection of the Four Noble Truths entails the nonexistence of the Sangha. For absent practice and the fruits of the path-that is, realization and accomplishment-there will be no practicioners and realizers.
5. If there is no doctrine and spiritual community,
How can there be a Buddha?
If emptiness is conceived in this way,
The three jewels are contradicted.
The whole point of the Dharma and the Sangha is to make it possible to attain buddhahood. The Dharma provides the philo- sophical insight and knowledge necessary for enlightenment; and the Sangha provides the teachers, the encouragement, the models, the opportunity for practice, and other support necessary for the strenuous and perseverant practice of the path. The attainment of buddhahood requires reliance on these two. So, if they are re- jected, so is the possibility of buddhahood. So, the opponent          Niigiirjuna's doctrine of emptiness, in virtue of undermin-
107. Not only the historical Buddha, but also the possibility of buddhahood in         and one's own future buddhahood in particular, a point emphasized by the Most Ven. Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche in      comments,
￼296 THE T.EXT AND COMMENTARY
ing the Four Noble Truths, denies the existence of the three ref-
uges and makes Buddhism itself impossible.
6.       you assert that there are no real fruits. And no Dharma. The Dharma itself
And the conventional truth
Will be contradicted.
The implicit dilemma with which Nagarjuna here confronts him- self is elegant. For as we have seen, the distinction between the two truths or two vantage points-the ultimate and the conventional- is fundamental to his own method. So when the opponent charges thai the assertion of the nonexistence of such things as the Four Noble Truths and of the arising, abiding, and ceasing of entities is contradictory both to conventional wisdc:&gt;m and to the ultimate truth (viz., that all phenomena are dependent, impermanent, merely aris- ing, abiding momentarily and ceasing, and only existing convention- ally, empty of inherent existence), Nagarjuna is forced to defend himself on both fronts and to comment on the connection between these standpoints.
Nagarjuna launches the reply by charging the opponent with foist- ing the opponent's own understanding of emptiness on Nagarjuna. Though this is not made as explicit in the text as one might like, it is important to note that the understanding Nagarjuna has in mind is one that, in the terms of Madhyamika, reifies emptiness itself. This wi\l be made more explicit in XXIV: 16:
7. We say that this understanding of yours
Of emptiness and the purpose of emptiness
And of the significance of emptiness is incorrect. As a c:onsequence you are harmed by it.
8. The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma
Is based on two truths:
A truth of worldly convention And an ultimate truth.
This is the first explicit announcement of the two truths in the text. lt is important to note that they are introduced as two truths,
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 297
and that they are introduced as distinct. This will be important to bear in mind later. For it is tempting, since one of the truths is characterized as an ultirnate truth, to think of the conventional as "less true."1"" Moreover, we will see later thai while the truths are introduced as quite distinct here, they are in another sense identi- fied later. lt will be important to be very elear about the respective senses in which they are distinct and one. The term translated here as "truth of worldly convention" (Tib:· kun-rdzob bden-pa, Skt: safPvrti-satya) denotes a truth dependent upon tacit agreement, an everyday truth, a truth about things as they appear to accurate ordinary investigation, as judged by appropriate human stan- dards.109 The term "ultimate truth" (Tib: dam-pa'i don gyi bden-
108. See. for instance. the comments of Murti (1985) on this verse:
The paramdrtha, however, can be understood and realized only             only as we removt the sarpavffl, the forms wbich tbought has already, unconsciously and beginninglessly, ascribed to the real. The real is to be uncovered, discovered and realized as the reality of appearances. In the order of our discovery, the removal of           must precede our knowledge of the paramdrtha. (p. xxvi [emphasis in the original]).
As we shall see, this analysis of the distinction between the two truths as an appearancelreality distinction is explicitly rejected by Nigirjuna in XXIV: 18, 19. I agree with Kalupahana ( 1986), who notes that "drtha as well asparamartha arc truths (satya). The farmer is not presented as an un-truth (a-salya) in relation to the latter, as.it would be in an absolutistic tradition. Neither is· the farmer sublated by the lat- ter." But Kalupabana goes a bit too far when he continues, "There is no indication whatsoever that these arc two truths with different standing as higher and lower" (p. 69). For there is clearly an important sense in which, despite their ontic unity, the ultimate truth is epistemologically and soteriologically more signifi.cant than the con- ventional. Kalupahana also em in my view when he characterizes the two truths as "two fruits" and, hence, as diffcrent but·complementary maral ideals (p. 332). In his zeal to see Nagarjuna as a non-Mahiyina philosopher and as a Jamesian pragmatist, l fear that he distorts the central epistemological and metaphysical themes of the text.
109. lt should be noted that both Sanskrit and Tibetan offer two terms, each of which in tum is often translated "conventional truth." Sanskrit presents "satriv(ti- satya" and "vyavahara-sarya." the former is deligbtfuHy ambiguous.           can mean conven1ional in all of its normal senses-everyday, by agreement, ordinary, etc. But it can also mean concealing, or occluding. This ambiguity is exploited by Midhyamika philosophers, who emphasize that the conventional, in occluding its conventional character, covers up its own emptiness.
Candrakirti's commentary to this verse distinguishes three readings, reftecting three distinct etymologies: "SarrivJ;"ti" can mean concealing; it can mean mutually dependent; it can mean transactional, or dependent on linguistic convention. The latter is captured exactly by the second term "vyavahdra," which simply means

10. Without a foundation in the conventional truth,
The significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, Liberation is not achieved.
The goal of Miidhyamika philosophy is liberation from suffering. But that liberation, on Niigarjuna's view, can only be achieved by insight into the ultimate nature of things-their emptiness-and in- deed inio the ultimate nature of emptiness, which we shall see to be emptiness again. But this insight can only be gained through reason- ing and hence through language and thought. And the truth that is to be grasped can only be indicated through language and thought, which are thoroughly conventional and which can only be inter- preted literally at the conventional level. It is important to see here
transactional-determined by convention. Tibetan presents not      "kun-rdzob bden-pa," which literally means costμmed, or disguised, picking up on one of the meanings of "samv(ti," but "Jha-snyed bde11-pa," which means          or by agreement, picking up the other meaning. Because these two Tibetan terms are, according to most Tibetan interpretations of Madhyamika, identicaJ in extension, they are often treated as synonymous. This is a bit unfortunate for when we come to the parallel pair of terms for conventional existents, "kun-rdzob yod-pa" and "tha- snyed yod-pa," this coextension breaks down in an important case: emptiness is a nominal (tha snyed) existent, but not a concealing (kun-rdzob) existent.
See Nagao (1989), pp. 40-59, and (1991), pp. 13-16, for additional discussion of the Sanskrit etymologies and of the sense in which the conventional truth is a truth. Kalupahana (1986), however, argues (p. 88) that whenever Nagarjuna uses the terms "sal'flvrti" or "vyavahara," he "was referring to moral conventions of good or bad." He argues that the          between the two truths is a relation between an       life and conventional morality. This claim about usage, however, seems just
plain erroneous.

that Nagarjuna is not disparaging the conventional by contrast to the ultimate, but is arguing thai understanding the ultimate nature of things is completely dependent upon understanding conventional truth. This is true in several senses: First, as we shall see, understand- ing the ultimate nature of things just is understanding thai their con- ventional nature is merely conventional. But second, and perhaps less obscurely, in order to explain emptiness-the ultimate nature of all phenomena-one must use words and concepts and explain such things as interdependence, impermanence, and so forth. And all of these are conventional phenomena. So both in the end, where the understanding of ultimate truth is in an important sense the un- derstanding of the nature of the conventional, and on the path, where the cultivation of such understanding requires the use of con- ventions, conventional truth must be affirmed and understood.110

A person of little intelligence is destroyed. Like a snake incorrectly seized
Or like a spell incorrectly cast.
110. See Streng (1973), pp. 92-98, and Huntington (1989), pp. 48-50, for a simi- lar analysis. (But Huntington places a bit too much emphasis on specifically social convention in his analysis of the conventional truth, neglecting the role of what the Midhyamikas call "primal ignorance;„ or the "innate disposition to reify," embodied inourordinary cogoitive tendencies, which may, in fact, be ontogenetically more fun- damental than the specifically social conventions to which they give rise and that the n reinforce them. See esp. pp. 52-54.) This analysis contrasts sharply with Muni's (1973) assertion that "the Absolute (ultimate truth] is transcendent to thought . . . phenomena in their essential form" (p. 9). This view of the ultimate truth as an abso- lute standing behind, or in opposition to, a relative truth of the conventional, as a Kantian noumenal world stands to a phenomen;ll world, is quite contrary to Nigirjuna's doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness, See also Murti (1955) for an ex- tended defense of this reading and Sprung (1973), esp. pp. 43-46, for another argu- ment for a radical discontinuity between the two truths.      and Dragonetti (1981) agree with tbis view of Midhyamika as nihilistic with regard to the conventional truth: "As a consequence of their argumentation and analysis, the Midhyamikas deny the existence of the           reality, of all of its manifestations. . . .
As a result ... there remains (we are obliged to say) 'something' completely different. . . . That 'something' is the true reality" (p. 276). Crittenden (1981) is in substantial agreement with this view.
Curiously, even Nagao seems to succumb to this temptation to absolutize empti- ness when he turns to his analysis of the ultimate truth, despite his emphasis on the identity of the two truths when he is elucidating the conventional. See Nagao (1989), pp. 71-72, 75-76.
￼300 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The Miidhyamika doctrine of eniptiness is subtle and is easily misinterpreted. In particular, it is often misinterpreted as a thor- oughgoing nihilism about phenomena. This is so not only among classical Indian critics of Miidhyamika, in both Buddhist and non- Buddhist philosophical schools, but also among Westem critics, who have sometimes regarded it as completely negative. 111 In this respect, Miidhyamika philosophy has suffered from the same fate as much Westem sceptical philosophy, including thai of the Pyrrhonians and of Hume and Wittgenstein, all of whom were at considerable pains to wam readers against interpreting them as denying the existence of ordinary entities, but all of whom have been repeatedly read as doing so. Niigiirjuna is here charging the opponent represented in the opening verses with interpreting the assertion thai a phenomenon is empty as the assertion thai it is nonexistent. Nothing, Niigiirjuna will argue, could be further from the truth. 112
111. E.g., Stcherbatsky (1930), Robinson (1967), and Wood (1994). 112. Wood (1994) on p. 202 says that he is
unable to find anything in MK 24 to support (the non-nihilistic] interpretation of MK 24.7-11. ... According to [the non-nihilistic interpretation], we would have to read MMK 24 as follows. According to NAgArjuna, the doctrine that eVerything is void does not mean that everything is unreal or nonexistent; it only means that everything is empty in the sense that everything arises and perishes through a process of dependent co-origination (pratitya-samutpdda); and the critic must be .taken as criticizing this position.
Wood thcn argues           that no Buddhist opponent would criticize the doctrine of dependent co-origination. This is in fact the comerstone of Wood's nihilistic reading of the text, as it must be. For this chapter clinches the non-nihilistic interpre- tation. So, a few things deserve note: While Wood cannot find anything in this chapter to support suc:h a reading, commentators including both BuddhapAlita and Bhavaviveka, as well as Candrakirti and Tsong Khapa, not to mention a host of modem Western and Tibetan scholars, have found quite a bit there. NS.glirjuna's disciple Aryadeva also insists in Catul].sdtaka on a non-nihilistic reading of empti- ness. In fact Wood does have the neccssary gloss on the verses in question just right. But he misses the position attributed to the oppoilent entirely. The opponent need not be reprcsented as denying that phenomena arc codepcndently originated. Rather the opponent is failing to see that that dependent co-origination is empti- ness. He hence sees the attribution of emptiness as the denial, rather than the assertion, of codependent origination. Hence the entirc remainder of the chapter is devoted not to arguing for emptiness, nor to arguing for the reality of codependent origination, but rather to arguing for their identity. To miss this is to miss the entire point of the text.
￼Examination o f the Four Noble· Truths 301
12. For thai reason-that the Dhanna is
Deep and difficult to understand and to leam- The Buddha's mind despaired of
Being able to teach it.
13. You have presented fallacious refutations
That arc not relevant to emptiness. Your confusion about emptiness Does not belong to me.
Nagarjuna here        denies that his view sustains the            reading,       granting that if one treats emptiness as nonexis- tence, all of the absurd conclusions that the opponent enumerates · indeed         But, Nagarjuna continues in XXIV: 14, the interpre- tation of the entire Madhyamika system depends          on how one understands the concept of emptiness. If that is understood correctly, everything            into        lf it is misunderstood, nothing in the system makes any sense:
14. For bim to whom emptiness is elear,
Everything becomes elear.
For bim to whom emptiness is not elear, Nothing becolnes clear.113
15. When you foist on us All of your errors
You are like a man who has mounted his horse And has forgotten thai very horse.
Here is the idea behind this image, a standard trope in           Indian rhetoric: A man with a berd of horses thinks that he is missing one and accuses you of having stolen it. As he rides around and counts his horses, he always comes up one short. But you point out to him that the one he is accusing you of          is in fact the very one he is riding but has forgotten to count. Likewise, Nagarjuna is saying, the opponent who confuses the Madhyamika
113. The Tibetan term translated as "elear" here is "rung-ba" which literally means suitable, or appropriate. But while that makes sense in Tibetan, it clearJy doesn't in English, and the t:ontext indicates "elear" a&amp; the word that best captures the meaning.
￼302 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
analysis in terms of emptiness with nihilism is charging Nagarjuna with a nihilism that is in fact his owo. Nagarjuna will argue, that is, that while the opponent claims to preserve the reality of the three jewels, the Four Noble Truths, and dependently arisen phenomena against Nagarjuna's nihilism, Nagarjuna himself can explain the reality of these things, though it will tum out that on the oppo- nent's view they must be nonexistent!114 At this point the positive philosophical program of this chapter begins.
16. If you perceive the existence of all things In terms of their essence,
Then this perception of all things
Will be without the perception of causes and conditions.
There are two related assertions contained in this critical verse: First, at the conventional level, the opponent, in virtue of thinking that to exist is to exist inherently, will be unable to account for dependent arising and hence for anything that musi be depen- dently arisen. As Nagarjuna will make explicit later on, !his will include such things as suffering, its causes, nirval)a, the path thereto, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the Buddha, as well as more mundane phenomena.
But secondly and more subtly, since the opponent is seeing ac- tual existence as existence as a discrete entity with an essence, it would follow that for the opponent the reality of emptiness would
114. ButseeWood(1994),pp. 115-16,foradramaticallydifferentreading(ofthe parallel verse in Vigrahavydvartani-but the points all go over) of this verse. Wood interprets emptiness as complete nonexistence and reads Nagarjuna as a thoroughgo- ing nihilist. So he interprets Niigiirjuna as asserting that if one sees conventional phenomena as real in any way, one is in trouble and that philosophical problems vanish only if one sees all apparent phenomena as illusions. In offering this interpreta- tion, Wood notes that Niigiirjuna often characterizes phenomena as Jike dreams or mirages. That is indeed so, but his interpretation of that simile is itself problematic. For a thing to be like a mirage or a dream is for it to exist in one way (as, e.g., a mirage), but to not exist in the way that it appears (as water). To put the point another way: Mirages reallyare mirages, but are not really water, though they might appearto be .. So conventional phenomena, according to the simile, really are empty, depen- dently·arisen, nominally real phenomena, but are notsubstantial, inherently existent phenomena, though they might appear to be. So, pace Wood, it is not Na8arjuna, but
· his opponent who is the nihilist here. See also Padhye (1988), esp. pp. 61-66, for a good critical discussion of the nihilistic reading.
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 303
entail that emptiness itself is an eolity, an inherently existing entity at that. To see emptiness in this way is to see it as radically different from conventional, phenomenal reality. It is to see the conven- tional as illusory and emptiness as the reality standing behind it. If Niigiirjuna were to adopt this view of emptiness, he would indeed have to deny the reality of the entire phenomenal, conventional world. This would also be to ascribe a special, nonconventional, nondependent hyperreality to emptiness itself. Ordinary things would be viewed as nonexistent, emptiness as substantially exis- tent. (It is important and central to the Miidhyamika dialectic to see that these go together-that nihilism about one kind of entity is typically paired with reification of another.) This view is not uncommon in Buddhist philosophy, and Niigiirjuna is clearly aware that it might be suggested by his owo position. So. Niigiirjuna's reply must begin by distancing himself from this reified view of emptiness itself and hence from the dualism it entails. Only then can he show that to reify emptiness in this way would indeed entail the difficulties his imaginary opponent adumbrates, difficulties not attaching to Niigiirjuna's owo view. 115 This brings us to the central verses of this chapter:
17. Effects and causes And agent and action
And conditions and arising and ceasing And effects will be rendered impossible.
Again, this verse is to be read at two levels: At the conventional level, the opponent, through reifying phenomena in order to pre- serve their conventional reality, will deny the possibility of any
115. So, for instance, when Wood (1994) writes on p. 161 that "[he does] not think that there is a non-nihilistic sense of the phrase 'does not exist,' " he is succumbing to the very view that Niigirjuna criticizes here-the view that to exist is to exist inherently and that to not exist inherently is not to exist at all. The non- nihilistic sense of "does not exist" is in play when Nligirjuna, in providing a reduc- tio on the opponent's view, is taking inherent existence as the meaning of "exis- tence." Given that understanding, Nigirjuna can quite easily say that, e.g., the self does not exist white retaining his commitment to its conventional existence. He can aJsO say that no inherently existent phenomena exist at all without denying the conventional existence of conventionaJ phenomena.
￼304 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
kind of dependence, impermanence, or action. But more impor- tantly, if Niigarjuna's analysis of these things as empty meant thai they were nonexistent and that only emptiness exists, then Nagar- juna himself would be denying the empirical reality of these phe- nomena. That is, not only would an inherently existent phenome- nal world be devoid of change, dependency,. and so forth, but inherently existent emptiness would render the phenomenal world completely nonexistent.
This defines the straits between which the middle path musi be found, as      as the presupposition that generates both extremes: The extreme of reification of the phenomenal world depends upon viewing emptiness nihilistically; the extreme of reification of empti- ness requires us to be nihilistic about the phenomenal world. A middle path rnust reify neither and hence must regard emptiness, as well as all empty phenomena, as empty. Both extremes presup- pose that to exist is to exist inherently. They only disagree about whether this inherent existence is properly ascribed to conven- tional phenomena or to their ultimate nature. Nagarjuna will deny exactly that presupposition, arguing that to exist is to exist conven- tionally and that both conventional phenomena and their ultimate natures exist in exactly that way. The next verse is the climax of the entire text and can       be said to contain the entire Madhyamika system in embryo. lt is perhaps the most often quoted and exten- sively commented on verse in all of Mahayana philosophy:
18. Whatever is dependently co-arisen That is explained to be emptiness.
That, being a dependent designation,
Is itself the middle way.
19. Something that is not dependently arisen, Such a thing does not exist.
Therefore a nonempty thing Does not exist.
These two verses demand careful scrutiny and are best discussed together. In XXIV: 18, Niigiirjuna establishes a critical three-way relation between emptiness, dependent origination and verbal con- vention, and asserts that this relation itself is the Middle Way toward        his entire philosophical system is aimed. As we shall
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 305
see, this is the basis for understanding the emptiness of emptiness itself. Nagarjuna is asserting thai the dependently arisen is empti- ness. Emptiness and the phenomenal world are not two distinct things. They are, rather, two characterizations of the same thing. To say of something thai il is dependently co-arisen is to say thai il is empty. Tu say of something thai it is empty is another way of saying that it arises dependentlyn•
Moreover, whatever is dependently co-arisen is          estab- lished. Thai is, the identity of any dependently arisen thing depends upon verbal conventions. To say of a thing thai it is dependently arisen is to say thai its identity as a single entity is nothing more than its being the referent of a word. The thing itself, apart from conventions of individuation, has no identity. To say of a thing thai its identity is a merely verbal fact about il is to say thai it is empty. To view emptiness in this way is to see it neither as an entity nor as unreal-it is to see it as                real.'"
Moreover, "emptiness" itself is asserted to be a dependent desig- nation (Tib: brten nas gdags-pa, Ski: prajnaptir-upiidtiya,). 118 Its referent, emptiness itself, is thereby asserted to be merely depen- dent and nominal-conventionally existent but ultimately empty. This is hence a middle path with regard to emptiness.119 To view
116. Padhye (1988), pp. 66-67, also emphasizes this              of emptiness and dependent arising.
117. His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in      remarks (Columbia University 1994), says:
Since dependent co-origination is used as a premise to argue for the Jack of inherent existence of things, it can't be independent of it. Lack of inherent existence must always be understood as negative and as a feature of conventional reality. . .. In MU/amadhyamakakdrikii these two truths-dependent co-origi- nation and emptiness-are taught as two perspectives on the same reality.
118. See Nagao (1991), pp. 190-94, for a useful discussion of alternative render- ings of this compound and of the interpretive issues raised in translating it. Nagao himself opts for "8 designation based upon (some materia!)." I find this both awkward and misleading; it commits Nagarjuna univocally to "some material" as the designative basis for emptiness, submerging the metalinguistic reading. Both seem to me to be clearly intended by the text.
119. Compare to Murti (1973):
Relativity or mutual dependence is a mark of the unreal. . . . For the Mad- hyamika, reciprocity, dependence, is the Jack of inner essence'. rauva, or the Real, is something in itself, self-evident, and self-existent. Reason, which understands things through distinction and relation is a principle of falsity, as it distorts and therebyhides the Real. Only the Absotute as the unconditioned is real . . . . (p. 16)
￼306 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
the dependently originated world in this way is to see it neither as nonempty nor as completely nonexistent. It is, viewed in this way, conventionally existent, but empty. So we have a middle path with regard to dependent origination. 120 To view convention in this way
This represents as elear a statement as one would like of the position that the conventionallultimate distinction is a version of an appearance/reality or phenom- enonlnoumenon distinction, a position I read Ni.igirjuna as at pains to refute. As Murti says later in this essay (p. 22), "I have interpreted         and the doctrine of the TWo Truths as a kind of Absolutism, not Nihilism. Niigiirjuna's 'no views about reality' should .not be taken as advocating a 'no-reality view.' "
Nagao (1991) concurs with Murti on this point: „The 1Wofold Truth is composed of pararnirtha (superworldly or absolute) and sarpvrti (worldly or conventional). These two Iie sha.rply contrasted, the former as the real truth, and the latter as the truth concealed by the veil of falsehood and ignorance" (p. 46). Now while Nagao, to be sure, is less disparag.ing of the conventional truth than is Murti, noting the altemative etymologies of "sar.rivrti-satya" and allowing that "... the 1\vofold Truth opens a channel by which language recovers itself in spite of its faJsehood and ignorance," he emphasizes that "the 'silence' ofparanuJrtha is true 'Wisdom' "(p. 46) Hence in the end, he agrees with Murti on the critical interpretive claim that the two truths are radically distinct from one another and that the conventional truth is not in fact a truth in any straightforward sense. See also Napper [1993J and Hopkins [1983J for a similar interpretation.
There are two things to say about this interpretation: First, as Nigllrjuna would be quick to point out, absolutism is not the only altemative to nihilism. Mad- hyamika is an attempt to forge a middle path between precisely those two extremes. And second, to say that a rejection of absolutism is a rejection of the reality of the world tout court is to presuppose exactly the equation of existence with inherent existence that is the target of Nigirjuna's critique. To the extent that "reality" is interpreted to be absolute reality, Nagarjuna indeed advocates a "no-reality view." But to the extent that we accept the Miidhyamika reinterpretation of "reality" as conventional reality, no such consequence follows.
Streng (1973) agrees:
Because Nagiirjuna's ultimate affirmation is pralilyasamutpdda, any conven- tional affirmation that might suggest an absolute, in the form of a dogma or doctrine, is avoided. Even        asvabhava, Tathagala or pratyaya cannot be transformed into absolutes..
. . . The highest awareness, which is needed for release from svabhdva, is nol the result of moving from the finite to the infinite, but the release from ignorance about the          co-origination of anything at all. Paramarthasatya, then, is living in full awareness of dependent co-origination. . . . (p. 36)
120. Nagao (1989) puts this point nicely:
When the birth-death cycle ilself is ernpty, when there is nothing that exists permanently as its own essence; when, without self-identity all the functions of beings depend upon others, then dependent co-arising is emptiness and empti·
, ness is dependent co-arising. . .
￼Examination ofthe Four Noble Truths 307
is to view it neither as ontologically insignificant-it determines the character of the phenomenal world-nor as ontologically efficacious-it is empty. And so we also have a middle way with regard to convention. Finally, given the nice ambiguity in the refer- ence of "that," (de ni), not only are "dependent arising" and "emp- tiness" asserted to be dependent designations, and their referents hence merely          but the very relation between them is as- sened to be so dependent and hence to be empty.
This last fact, the emptiness of the relation between the conven- tional world of dependently arisen phenomena and emptiness itself, is ofextreme importance at             ofthe Madhyamika dialec- tic and comes to salience in Nagiirjuna's Vigrahavytlvartani and in Candrakirti's Prasannapadii. For this amounts to the emptiness of the central ontological tenet of Nagarjuna's system and is what allows bim to claim, despite all appearances, that he is positionless. That is, Nagarjuna thereby has a ready reply to the following appar- ent reductio argument (reminiscent of classical Greek and subse- quent Westem challenges to Pyrrhonian scepticism): You say that all things are, from the ultimate standpoint, nonexistent. That must then apply to your own thesis. lt therefore is really nonexistent, and your words, only nominally true. Yourown thesis, therefore, denies its own ground and is self-defeating. This objection would be a sound one against a view that in fact asserted its own inherent existence, or grounded its truth on an inherently existing ontological basis. But, Nagarjuna suggests here, that is not the case for his account. Rather everything, including this very thesis, has only · nomina! truth, and nothing is either inherently existent or true in virtue of designating an inherently existent fact. This is hence one more point at which ladders must be kicked away.121
These morals are driven home in XXIV: 19, where Niigarjuna emphasizes that everything-and this must include emptiness-is
... The real is suchness where there is an identification of emptiness and dependent CO·arising whereby empty non·being "hollows out" every trace of inner selfhood. (p. 15)

￼308 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
dependently arisen. So everything-including emptiness-lacks in- herent existence. So nothing lacks the three coextensive properties of emptiness, dependent-origination, and conventional identity.
With this in hand, Niigiirjuna can reply to the critic: He points out (XXIV: 20-35) that, in virtue of the ;dentity of dependent origination and emptiness on the one hand and of ontological inde- pendence and intrinsic reality on the other, such phenomena as arising, ceasing, suffering, change, enlightenment, and so on-the very phenomena the opponent charges Niigiirjuna with denying- are possible only if they are empty. The tables are thus turned: li appeared thai Niigiirjuna, in virtue of arguing for the emptiness of these phenomena, was arguing thai in reality they do not exist precisely because for the reifier of emptiness, existence and empti- ness are opposites. But, in fact, because of the identity of empti- ness and conventional existence, it is the reifier who, in virtue of denying the emptiness of these phenomena, denies their existence. And it is hence the reifier of emptiness who is impaled on both horns of the dilemma he presented to Niigiirjuna: Contradicting the ultimate truth, the opponent denies thai these phenomena are empty; contradicting the conventional, he is forced to deny thai they even exist! And so Niigiirjuna can conclude:
20. If all this we re nonempty, as in your view, There would be no arising and ceasing.
Then the Four Noble Truths
Would become nonexistent.
The argument for this surprising turnabout reductio is straight- forwardly presented in the subsequent verses:
21. lf it is not dependently arisen, How could suffering come to be?
Suffering has been taught to be impennanent, And so cannot come from its owo essence.
The first noble truth is the truth of the existence of suffering. The opponent charges Niigiirjuna with denying the existence of suffering through asserting its emptiness. But, Niigarjuna points out, since emptiness is dependent origination, when the opponent
￼Examination of the Four Noble Tr.uths 309
denies its emptiness, he denies that suffering is dependently origi- nated. But he agrees that all phenomena are dependently origi- nated. He thus is forced to deny the existence of suffering. But for Nagarjuna, since existence amounts to emptiness, the asser- tion of the emptiness of suffering affirms, rather than denies, its existence.
22. If something comes from its own essence, How couId it ever be arisen?
It follows that if one denies emptiness
There can be no arising (of suffering).
The second noble truth is that suffering has a cause. But, again, if the opponent asserts the nonemptiness of suffering, he asserts that it does not arise from causes and conditions. Yet Nagarjuna's analysis shows that it must, in virtue of its emptiness, be so arisen and thus accords with the second truth.
23. If suffering had an essence, Its cessation would not exist.
So if an essence is posited, One denies cessation.
Similarly, the third noble truth is the truth of cessation. But inher- ently existent things cannot cease. Empty ones can. Nagarjuna's analysis thus explains the third truth; the reifier contradicts it.
24. l f the path bad an essence, Cultivation would not be appropriate.
lf this path is indeed cultivated, It cannot have an essence.
25. l f suffering, arising, and Ceasing are nonexistent,
By what path could one seek
To obtain the cessation of suffering?
The fourth truth is the truth of the path. Again, the path only makes sense, and cultivation of the path is only possible, if suffer-
￼310 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
ing is impermanent and            and if the nature of mind is empty and hence            The path, after all, is a path from suffering and to awakening. If the former cannot cease and the latter does not depend on cultivation, the path is nonexistent. But it is the analysis in terms of emptiness that makes this coherent. An analysis on which either the phenomena were inherently existent or on which emptiness was and the phenomena were therefore nonexistent would .make nonsense of the Four Noble Truths. Nagarjuna now turns to the implications for this line of argument for the three jewels, the Sangha, the Buddha, and the Dharma:
26. If nonunderstanding comes to be Through its essence.
How will understanding arise? Isn't essence stable?
If ignorance is real and thus for the opponent inherently existent, there is no possibility of replacing it with insight. Therefore the cultivation of Buddhist practice is impossible, or at least pointless.
27. In the same way, the activities of Relinquishing, realizing, and meditating
And the four fruits Would not be possible.
28. For an essentialist,
Since the fruits through their essence
Arc already unrealized,
In what way could one attain them?
So the essentialist has a dilemma if he wants to maintain the possibility of a community of practicioners (the Sangha) and of a path for them to practice: Either the ignorance in which they find themselves and that serves as the impetus to practice is inherently existent, in which case practice is bound to be inefficacious, or the understanding they hope to achieve is inherently existent, in which case there is no need to practice since it is already present and no use in practicing since its existence is independent of practice.
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 311
29. Without the fruits, there areno attainers of the fruits, Or enterers. From this it follows that
The eight kinds of persons do not exist.
If these don't exist, there is no spiritual community.
The consequence of this is that there is no Sangha. The existence of the Sangha is entirely dependent upon the existence of the path and of the possibility of the fruits of the path-increasing degrees of realization since the Sangha is, by definition, the community of practicioners of the path.
30. From the nonexistence of the Noble Truths
Would follow the nonexistence of the true doctrine. If there is no doctrine and no spiritual community, How could a Buddha arise?
But it would also follow that there is no Dharma-no true Bud- dhist doctrine since that is          on the existence of the Four Noble Truths. And          as Nagarjuna emphasizes in XXIV: 31, 32, since the attainment of buddhahood depends upon the study and practice of the Dharma within the context of the spiritual community, the opponent's view, unlike Nagarjuna's, has the con- sequence that no buddha can arise. Moreover, if the Buddha and enlightenment were each inherently existent, they would be inde- pendent and could hence arise independently, which is absurd. To be a buddha is to be enlightened, and vice versa:
31. For you, it would follow thai a Buddha Arises independent of enlightenment.
And for you, enlightenment would arise
Independent of a Buddha.
32. For you, one who through his essence
Was unenlightened,
Even by practicing the path to enlightenment Could not achieve enlightenment.
Nagarjuna has hence demonstrated that any reification, whether of the conventional or of the ultimate, ends up, paradoxically, denying the existence of the very things it reifies. And any
￼312 THE TEXT. AND COMMENTARY
reification renders the most fundamental Buddhist philosophical insights and practices incoherent. A thoroughgoing analysis in terms of emptiness, on the other hand-one thai includes the un- derstanding of the emptiness of emptiness-renders the entire phe- nomenal world as well as emptiness itself comprehensible as nomi- nally existent, empirically actual, and dependently arisen-real but essenceless. At this stage, Nii.gii.rjuna shifts to the charge lev- eled by the opponent in XXIV: 2 thai no practice is intelligible in the context of emptiness and argues thai, on the contrary, practice is intelligible only in thai context. The argument is a reprise of earlier moves, and so is rather straightforward:
33. Moreover, one could never perform Right or wrong actions.
If this were all nonempty what could one do? That with anessence cannot be produced.
Nii.gii.rjuna now turns to the   •    dimensions of the extreme positions and their consequences for the Buddhist doctrine of karma, specifically with regard to the consequences for one's own life of one's actions. Nonempty phenomena, such as the opponent wishes to posil, are seen, on analysis, to be static. But practice and action require dependence, change, and a regular relation between one's actions and one's future state. So in the preceding verse, Nagarjuna notes that in a static, nonempty world, we can't even make sense of the possibility of action. He then points out (XXIV: 34) thai even were action possible, in virtue of the impossibility of change and dependence in an essentialist universe, there would be no consequences of those actions. For to be a consequence is to be dependent, hence to be empty, hence from the standpoint of the essentialist-whether reificationist or nihilist-nonexistent.
34. For you, from neither right nor wrong actions Would the fruit arise.
If the fruit arose from right or wrong actions, According to you, it wouldn't exist.
35. If, for you, a fruit arose From right or wrong actions,
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 313 Then, having arisen from right or wrong actions
How could that fruit be nonempty?
The reificationist develops a strict dichotomy between things that exist inherently and things that are completely nonexistent. That dichotomy exhausts the ontological domain. But neither possi- bility for understanding the nature of practice, the practicioner, or the fruits of practice makes sense ofaction. If the relevant phenom- ena are granted inherent existence, their essence precludes devel- opment and change. If, on the other hand, they lack essence and hence, for the reifier, are completely nonexistent, there Iiterally is no practice, in any sense'. But if they are conceived of as empty and hence empirically and conventionally real, yet essenceless and de- pendent, the possibility and purpose of practice fali out straightfor- wardly. So it is the reifier, not Nagarjuna, who makes action and soteriology impossible, and Nagii&lt;juna and not the reifier who rescue them from ontological oblivion.
36. l f dependent arising is denied, Emptiness itself is rejected.
This       contradict
All of the worldly conventions.
Recall the other hom of the dilemma in XXIV: 6. The opponent charged Nagarjuna not only with contradicting fundamental Bud- dhist tenets, but with contradicting the conventional truth as well. Nagarjuna has responded up to this point to the first charge, tuming it back on the opponent. He now does the same with the second.
Nagarjuna suggests that to assert the nonemptiness of phenom- ena and of their interrelations when emptiness is properly under- stood is not only philosophically deeply confused, but is contradic- tory to common sense. We can make sense of this argument in the following way: Common sense neither posits nor requires intrinsic reality in phenomena or a real causal nexus. Common sense holds the world to be a network of dependently arisen phenomena. So common sense only makes sense if the world is asserted to be empty. Hence it is the opponent, not Nagarjuna, who disagrees with the conventional truth.
￼314 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The standpoint of emptiness is hence not at odds with the con- ventional standpoint, only with a particular philosophical under- standing of it-that which takes the conventional to be more than merely conventional. What is curious-and, from the Buddhist standpoint, sad-about the human condition, on this view, is the naturalness and seductiveness of that philosophical perspective.122
This, of course, is the key to the soteriological character of the text: Reification is the root of grasping and craving and hence of all suffering. And it is perfectly natural, despite its incoherence. By understanding emptiness, Nagarjuna intends one to break this habit and extirpate the root of suffering. But if in doing so one falls into the abyss of nihilism, nothing is achieved. For then action itself is impossible and senseless, and one's realization amounts to nothing. Or again, if one relinquishes the reification of phenomena but reifies emptiness, that issues in a new grasping and craving- the grasping of emptiness and the craving for NirviiQa-and a new round of suffering. Only with the simultaneous realization of the emptiness, but conventional reality, of phenomena and of the emp- tiness of emptiness, argues Nagarjuna, can suffering be wholly uprooted.
Let us consider now more carefully what it is to say that empti- ness itself is empty. The claim, even in the context of Buddhist philosophy, does have a somewhat parndoxical air. For emptiness is, in Mahayana philosophical thought, the ultimate nature of all phenomena. And the distinction between the merely conventional nature of things and their ultimate nature would seem to mark the distinction between the apparent and the real. While it is plausible to say that what is merely apparent is empty of reality, it seems
122. Thispointrequiresemphasis.ForNigirjunaisnotmerelyspeakingtoand correcting philosophers. He is no Berkeley, suggesting that his own position is that of common sense and that only a philosopher would reify. In fact, it is fundamental to any Buddhist outlook, and certainly to Nigirjuna's view, that one of the root           that affticts all non·buddhas is the innate tendency to reify. But that tendency is raised to high art by metaphysics. Nigirjuna intends his attack to strike both at the prereOective delusion and at its more sophisticated philosophical coun- terpart. But in doing so, he is not denying, and is in fact explaining, the nonmetaphysicaJ part of our commonsense framework-that part that enables us to act and to communicate and,            for Nigirjuna, to practice the Buddhist path.
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 315
nihilistic to say that what is ultimately real is empty of reality, and as we have seen, the Miidhyamika are quite consciously an- tinihilistic. But again, when we say that a phenomenon is empty, we say, inter alia, that it is impermanent,123 that it depends upon conditions and that its identity is dependent upon convention. Do we        want to say of each phenomenon that its emptiness-the fact that it is empty-is itself impermanent; itself dependent on something else; itself dependent upon conventions? It might at least appear that even if all other properties of conventional en- tities were so, their emptiness would be an eternal, independent, essential fact.
lt may be useful to approach the emptiness of emptiness by first asking what it would be to treat emptiness as nonempty. When we say that a phenomenon is empty, we mean that when we try to specify its essence, we come up with nothing. When we look for the substance that underlies the properties, or the bearer of the parts, we find none. When we ask what it is that gives a thing its identity, we stumble not upon ontological facts but upon conven- tions. For a thing to be nonempty would be for it to have an essence discoverable upon analysis, for it to be a substance inde- pendent of its attributes, or a bearer of parts, for its identity to be self-determined by its essence. A nonempty entity can be       characterized                 
For emptiness to be nonempty would be for it to be a substantial entity, an independent existent, a nonconventional phenomenon. On such a view, emptiness would be entirely distinct from any conventional phenomenon. It would, on sucha view, be the object of correct perception, while conventional phenomena would be
123. To be sure, both in the Abidharma literature and in most Mihayana meta- physical literature, space is regarded as permanent, despite being a conventional phenomenon. There are two things to say about this apparent counterexample: First, on general metaphysical grounds the claim is suspect. Whether one argues along Kantian lines, or from general relativity theory, space apparently shares, from the transcendental point of view, the impennanence of all other phenomena. But second, and for the purposes of understanding this text, more importantly, Nigirjuna never asserts the permanence of space and repeatedly associates empti- ness with impermanence. I would thus argue that other Mahayana literature to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in Nigirjuna's presentation of Miidbyamika en- tails the permanence of space or indeed of any other entity.
￼316 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
the objects of delusive perception. While conventional phenomena would be dependent upon conventions, conditions, or the igno- rance of obstructed minds, emptiness, on such a view, would be apparent precisely when one sees through those conventions, dis- pels that ignorance, and overcomes those obstructions. Though such a position might appear metaphysically extravagant, it is hardly unmotivated. For one thing, it seems that emptiness does have an identifiable essence-namely the lack of inherent exis- tence. So if to be empty is to be empty of essence, emptiness fails on that count to be empty. Moreover, since all phenomena, on the Miidhyamika view, are empty, emptiness would appear to be eter- nal and independent of any particular conventions and, hence, not dependently arisen. The two truths, on such an ontological vision, are indeed radically distinct from one another.
But this position is, from Niigiirjuna's perspective, untenable. The best way to see that is this: Suppose that we take a conven- tional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts, that it cannot be distinguished in a principled way from its antecedent · and subsequent histories, and so forth. So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness-the emptiness of the table-to see what we find. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table's lack of inherent existence. No conventional table, no emptiness of the table. The emptiness is dependent upon the table and is, therefore, itself empty of inherent existence, as is the emptiness of thai emptiness, and so on, ad infinitum. To see the table as empty, for Niigiirjuna, is· not to somehow see "beyond" the illusion of the table to some other, more real entity. It is to see the table as conventional; as dependent. But the table that we see when we see its emptiness is the very same table, seen not as the substantial thing we instinctively posil, but rather as it is. Emptiness is hence not different from conventional reality-il is the fact that conventional reality is conventional. Hence it must be dependently arisen since it depends upon the existence of empty phenomena. Hence emptiness itself is empty. This is per- haps the most radical and deep step in the Miidhyamika dialectic, but it is also, as we shall see, the step that saves it from falling
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 317 into metaphysical extravagance and brings it back to sober prag-
matic scepticism.124
37. If emptiness itself is rejected, No action will be appropriate.
There would be action which did not begin, And there would be agent without action.
Without viewing the world as empty, we can make no sense of any human activity. Action would be pointless since nothing could be accomplished. Any existent action would have to have been etemal, and anyone who is an agent would be so independently of any action since agency would be an essential attribute.
38. I f there is essence, the whole world Will be unarising, unceasing,
And static. The entire phenomenal world
Would be immutable.
Without viewing the world as empty, we can make no sense of impermanence or dependent            and hence no sense of change.
39. I f it (the world) were not empty, Theo action would be without profit.
The act of ending suffering and
Abandoning misery and defilement would not exist.
Perhaps most important from the standpoint of Buddhist phe- nomenology and, though not hard to see, easy to overlook: We are       to reify ourselves, the objects in the world around us, a n d - in more abstract philosophical moods-theoretical constructs, val- ues, and so on because of an instinctual feeling that without an              real self, an              real world, and              real values, life has no real meaning and is utterly hopeless. Nagiirjuna emphasizes at the close of this chapter that this gets

(1990).
￼318 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
things exactly backward: If we seriously and carefully examine what such a reified world would be like, it would indeed be hope, less. But if instead we treat            others, and our values as empty, there is hope and a purpose to life. For then, in the context of impermanence and dependence, human action and knowledge make sense, and mora! and spiritual progress become possible. It is only in the context of u/timate nonexistence thai actua/ existence makes any sense at all.
40. Wboever sees dependent arising Also sees suffering
And its arising
And its cessation as well as the palb.
Nagarjuna closes as he opens, with the Four Noble Truths, this time connecting them not negatively, as in the beginning, to empti- ness, but positively, to dependent arising. Understanding the na- ture of dependent arising is itself understanding emptiness and is itself the understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
It is absolutely critical to understanding the dialectical structure not only of this chapter but of the entire text to see thai this doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness thai is the central thesis of Madhyamika philosophy emerges directly from XXIV: 18. For the emptiness of emptiness, as we have just seen, simply amounts to the identification of emptiness with the property of being depen- dently arisen     with the property of having an identity just in virtue of conventional, verba! designation. It is the fact thai empti- ness is no more than this thai makes it empty, just as it is the fact thai conventional phenomena in         are no more than conven- tional and no more than their parts and status in the causa! nexus thai makes them empty.
Paradox may appear to loom at this point. For, one might argue, if emptiness is empty, and to be empty is to be merely conven- tional, then the emptiness of any phenomenon is a merely conven- tional fact. Moreover, to say that entities are merely conventional is merely conventional. Hence it would appear optional, as all conventions are. Hence it would seem to be open to say thai things are in fact nonconventional and therefore nonempty. This would
￼Examination o f the Four Noble Truths 319
be a deep incoherence indeed at the heart of Niigiirjuna's system. But the paradox is merely apparent. The appearance of paradox derives from seeing "conventional" as functioning logically like a negation operator-a subtle version of the nihilistic reading Niigiir- juna is at pains to avoid, with a metalinguistic twist. For then, each iteration of uconventional" would cancel the previous occurrence, and the conventional character of the fact that things are conven- tional would amount to the claim that really they are not, or at least that they might not be. But in Niigiirjuna's philosophical approach, the sense of the term is more ontological than logical: To say of a phenomenon or of a fact that it is conventional is to characterize its mode of subsistence. It is to say that it is without an independent nature. The fact that a phenomenon is without inde- pendent nature is, to be sure, a further phenomenon-a higher order fact. But that fact, too, is without an independent nature. lt, too, is merely conventional. This is another way of putting the          nominalistic character of Miidhyamika philosophy.
So a Platonist, for instance, might urge (and the Miidhyamika would agree) that a perceptible phenomenon is ultimately unreal. But the Platonist would assert that its properties are ultimately real. And if some Buddhist-inlluenced Platonist would note that among the properties of a perceptible phenomenon is its emptiness and its conventional reality, s/he would assert that these, as proper- ties, are ultimately real. This is exactly where Niigiirjuna parts company with all forms of realism. For he gives the properties a nominalistic construal and asserts that they, including the proper- ties of emptiness and conventionality, are, like all phenomena, merely          merely empty, and merely conventional. And so on for their emptiness and conventionality. The nominalism under- cuts the negative interpretation of "conventional" and thereby ren- ders the regress harmless.
So the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness can be seen as inextricably linked with Niigiirjuna's distinctive account of the rela- tion between the two truths. For Niigiirjuna, as is also evident in this crucial verse, it is a mistake to distinguish conventional from ultimate reality-the dependently arisen from emptiness-at an ontological level. Emptiness jus! is the emptiness of conventional phenomena. To perceive conventional phenomena as empty is just
￼320 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
to see them as conventional and as dependently arisen. The difference-such as it is-between the conventional and the ulti- mate is a difference in the way phenomena are conceived/per- ceived. The point musi be formulated with some delicacy and cannot be formulated without a hint of the paradoxical about it: Conventional phenomena are typically represented as inherently existent. We typically perceive and conceive of external phenom- ena, ourselves, causa! powers, mora! truths, and so forth as inde- pendently existing, intrinsically identifiable, and substantial. But though this is, in one sense, the conventional character of conven- tional phenomena-the manner in which they are ordinarily experienced-to see them this way is precisely not to see them as conventional. To see      they are merely conventional, in the sense adumbrated above and defended by Niigiirjuna and his fol- lowers, is thereby to see them as empty, and this is their ultimate mode of existence. These are the two truths about phenomena: On the one hand, they are conventionally existent and the things we ordinarily say about them are in fact true, to the extent that we get it right on the terms of the everyday. Snow is indeed white, and there are indeed tables and chairs in this room. On the other hand, they are ultimately nonexistent. These two truths seem as different as night and day-being and nonbeing. But the import of this chapter and the doctrine we have been explicating is that their ultimate nonexistence and their conventional existence are the same thing. Hence the deep identity of the two truths. And this is because emptiness is not other than dependent arising and, hence, because emptiness is empty. .
Finally, at this stage we can see why Chapter I opens the text. The discussion of the emptiness of conditions and their relation to their effects is not only essential groundwork for this central argu- ment, but in fact anticipates it and brings its conclusion to bear implicitly on the whole remainder of the text, allowing us, once we see that, to read the entire text as asserting not only the emptiness of phenomena, but that emptiness understood as empty. To see this, note that this entire account depends upon the emptiness of dependent origination itself. Suppose for a moment that one had the view that dependent arising were nonempty (not a crazy view and not obviously incompatible with, and arguably entailed by,
￼Examination of the Four Noble Truths 321
certain Buddhist doctrines). Then from the identification of empti- ness with dependent arising would follow- the nonemptiness of emptiness. Moreover, if conventional phenomena are empty, and dependent        itself is nonempty and is identified with empti- ness, then the two truths are indeed two in every sense. Emptiness- dependent arising is self-existent, while ordinary phenomena are not, and one gets a strongly dualistic, ontological version of an appearance-reality distinction. So the argument for the emptiness of emptiness in Chapter XXIV and the identity of the two truths with which it is bound up depend            on the argument for the emptiness of dependent origination developed in Chapter I.
Having developed this           and deep thesis regarding the identity of the two truths, Niigiirjuna turns in the next chapter to the nature of the relation between salllsiira and nirviil)a and the nature of nirviil)a itself.
￼Chapter X:XV Examination of NirvaQ.a
This chapter continues the study of the nature of what are often thought of as ultimate realities and that of their relation to the conventional world. lt follows quite naturally on the preceding chapter, which considered the relation between emptiness and the conventional world. For insigbt into emptiness is, from the stand- point of Miidhyamika philosophy, an important precondition for entry into nirviina. And just as the ultimate truth is related to the conventional as an understanding of the way things really are as opposed to the way they appear to be, nirviina is related to sal)1siira as a state of awareness ofthings as they are as opposed to a state of awareness of things as they appear to be. But given the results of Chapter XXIV, and the surprising identification in entity of the conventional with the ultimate and the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness, one might well wonder about the status of nirviina. Is it no different from sal)1siira? If it is, how, and how is it related to sal)1siira? If not, why pursue it, or better, why aren'! we already there? Is nirvana empty? If not, how does it escape the Mad- hyamika dialectic? If it is, can it really be different from sal)1siira?
Niigarjuna begins the examination with a challenge from the reificationist, raised by the previous chapter:
!. If all this is empty,
Then there is no arising or passing away.
￼Examination ofNirvd114 323 By the relinquishing or ceasing of what
Does one wish nirvai;ia to arise?
Nirvai:ia is defined as a state one achieves when delusion and grasping cease, and when one relinquishes sarpsara and its entities. But if there is neither self, nor object, nor delusion, nor grasping, who relinquishes what, and in what manner? Moreover, if there is no arising or passing away from the ultimate point of view, how can nirvai:ia arise or sarpsara pass away? Nagarjuna replies, using the same dialectical strategy deployed in the previous chapter:
2. lf all this is nonempty,
Then there is no        or passing away. By the relinquishing or ceasing of what Does one wish nirv3Qa to arise?
Nirvai:ia would be precluded not by the emptiness of sarpsara, but rather by its inherent existence. For then it could not pass away. Nor could an inherently grasping grasper relinquish grasp- ing, or an inherently existent delusion be alleviated. The achieve- inent of nirvai:ia requires dependence, impermanence, and the pos- sibility of change, all of which are grounded in emptiness.
3. Unrelinquished, unattained,
Unannihilated, not permanent,
Unarisen, unceased:
This is how nirvaoa is described.
It is important that these predicates are all negative in character, and that they are all expressed, both in Sanskrit and in the Tibetan translation, with explicitly negative particles (Skt: a, Tib: med-pa). The point is thai no           of arty predicate to nirvai:ia, for Nagarjuna, can be literally true. For such a predication would purport to be an assertion thai nirvai:ia is an ultimately existent phenomenon with a determinate property, and there are no ulti- mately existent phenomena, not even nirvii1,,1a. Because nirvii1,,1a can only be spoken of by contrasting it in some sense with sarpsara and because there is no conventionally existent perceptible entity
￼324 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
thai could serve as a referent for the term, there is the terrible temptation when speaking of nirviiQa to think that, to the extent thai one is saying anything true of it in any sense, one is literally asserting an ultimate truth about an inherently existent thing or . state. One forgets thai once one transcends the bounds of conven- tion, there is no possibility of assertion.125
The discussion in XXV: 4-18 is framed by the tetralemma that would follow from considering nirviiQa to be something indepen- dent about which something could be said; or as a proper subject for a theory; or as a genuine alternative to sa111siira, from which it is inherently different. If it were so, it would have to either be existent, nonexistent, both, or neither. (Note that here Niigiirjuna uses the terms "existent"/"non-existent" in both their adjectival and         forms (Tib: dngosldngos-minlldngos-poldngos-med, Skt: bhiivalbhiivollabhiivalabhiivo] deliberately calling attention to their correlation. I have generally translated the Tibetan "dngos- po" as "entity" throughout this text. But for the purposes of this discussion in order to highlight the structure of the text, I switch in the next few verses to "existent.") Niigiirjuna will now argue thai none.of these alternatives is possible.
4. Nirv3i;ta is not existent.
lt would then have the characteristics of age and death. There is no existent entity
Without age and death.
NirviiQa is negatively characterized as release from sa111siira and the constant ftux, aging, death, and rebirth it comprises. But thai means thai since all entities have these characteristics, nirviit:ia can- not be thought of as an existent entity. And here we must be very careful: The point isn't thai nirviiQa can't be thought of as inherently existent. For inherently existent entities, if there were such things, would not have these characteristics. In this discussion, Niigiirjuna is rejecting the notion that nirviit:ia can be thought of as existent in any sense at all-even as a conventional entity. Thai is why we musi be so careful in our discourse-very careful indeed-for, as we shall
125. See Streng (1973), chap. 5.
￼Examination ofNirvdlJJJ 325
see in a moment, neither do we want.to say that nirviiQa is nonexis- tent. But moreover, Niigiirjuna will want in another sense to identify nirviiQa and sa!Jlsiira (see XXV: 19, 20 below), and there is clearly a sense in which we can say that samsaric phenomena exist and a sense in which we can say that they do not. (Again, see the discussion of the positive tetralemma in XVIII: 8 above.) The point here is thai though things seen from the standpoint of sa!Jlsiira and from the standpoint of nirviiQa are not different in entity, from the standpoint of sa!Jlsiira they can be characterized and appear as entities. But from the standpoint of nirviiQa, no characterization is possible since that involves the dualities and dichotomies introduced by language, including the positing of entities and characteristics, as well as their contraries and complements. These have only conventional and         existence, and no existence at all from the standpoint of nirviiQa. (See also the discussion of XXVII: 30 below.) In a sense this discussion can be seen as a useful commentary on chapter IX of the                            and, in particular, on the dramatic con- cluding remarks by          and nonremarks by Vimalaklrti on the subject of nonduality and ii;sight into emptiness:          indicates that the distinction between the conventional and ultimate is itself dualistic and hence merely conventional. To realize it is hence to en- ter into nondual awareness of emptiness. He then asks Vimalaklrti to comment on nonduality. Vimalaklrti remains silent.126
5. lf nirv3l)a were existent, Nirvir.ia would be compounded.
A non-compounded existent Does not exist anywhere.
126. His Holiness the Dalai Lama in oral remarks (Columbia University 1994) notes that "The ultimate nature of things-emptiness-is also unknowable, in that one cannot comprehend it as it is known in direct apprehension in meditation."
Nayak (1979) writes:
Being firmly entrenched in          and realizing that language has only a conven- tional use, an tlrya or a philosopher regards silence or noncommitment as the highest good or paramdrtha. And the attainment of paramdrtha in this sense, not in the sense of a transcendent reality, constitutes an essential feature of nirvii.rJa or liberation. (p. 478)
￼326 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
All empirical phenomena are compounded. But being com- pounded involves phenomena in the round of sal)lsiira. For since the recognition of compounds as unitary phenomena demands conventions of aggregation, to be compounded is, ipso facto, to have a merely .conventional existence. And it is the treatment of merely conventional, nominally existent phenomena as inherently existent entities that generates sal!lsiira. That is because from the standpoint of Buddhist soteriological theory, the foundation of suffering-the basie condition of sal)lsiira-is craving and the foundation of craving is the root delusion of taking to be inher- ently existent-and so worthy of being craved-that which is merely conventionally, or nominally existent. We are hence trapped in sal)lsiira exactly to the extent that we mistake the convention- ally existent as inherently existent. So given the contras! between nirviiQ.a and sal)lsiira and the fact that everything in sal)lsiira is compounded, nirviil)a cannot be compounded. So it is not exis- tent, even conventionally.
6. If nirvaoa were existent,
How could nirviJ)a be nondependent? A nondependent existent
Does not exist anywhere.
Sal)lsiira and dependent arising go hand in hand. For a phenome- non to be dependent is for it to be impermanent and for it to be subject to destruction. (See the discussion in Chapter XV.) Nirviil)a is supposed to be beyond all this. lt is, by definition, liberation from all that characterizes sal)lsiira. So again, nirviil)a cannot be a conven- tionally existent entity. (It is important to see that there is a sense in which nirviiQ.a is dependent and a sense in which it is independent, and these are not contradictory: Nirvai:ia is achieved in dependence upon the practice of the path and the accumulation of wisdom and merit. But once attained, inasmuch as from the standpoint of
· nirviil)a there areno entities at all, there is nothing on which nirviil)a can be said to depend. In this sense it is nondependent.) But all of this raises the obvious possibility that nirviil)a is simply not real at all-that it is completely nonexistent. This possibility is considered and rejected in the next two verses:
￼Examination ofNirvd'lfl 327
7. If nirvBi;ta were not existent,
How could it be appropriate for il to be nonexistent?
Where nirvliQa is not existent, lt cannot be a nonexistent.
To say thai nirvii!)a possesses the positive property of nonexis- tence is not coherent either. For then there would be nothing to which the predicate "nonexistent" could in fact apply. Note the difference between saying, in the sense relevant here, "nirvii!)a is nonexistent" and "Santa Claus does not exist." The latter, Niigiir- juna would certainly agree, is not only coherent but true. But in explaining the semantics of the latter, we can posil a concept of Santa Claus and interpret the sentence as asserting that that con- cept is not instantiated. But when, in trying to characterize nirvii!)a, one is tempted to say that it is a nonexistent, this is in response to the difficulty we have just noted in asserting that nirvii!)a in fact exists. The temptation is to assert then that it is real, but has some kind of ghostly reality as a substratum of the property "nonexistent." But that is simply incoherent-an attempt to have it both ways. So the predicate "does not exist" cannot, in this case, even be          lf there is no nirvii!)a at all, there is no such basis of predication. Even this apparently negative discourse about nirvii!)a is then blocked, to the degree that it is taken literally as positive attribution of a negative predicate.
8. If nirv3JJ.a were not existent,
How could nirv3JJ.a be nondependent? Wbatever is nondependeflt
Is not nonexistent.
Moreover, Niigarjuna reminds us, one of the reasons that we rejected the view that nirval)a is an entity in the first place is that it is nondependent. The latter assertion is, of course, intended in a merely negative sense-a denial of the possibility of characterizing nirvii!)a as dependent, or of recognizing dependent phenomena or dependency from the standpoint of nirviil)a. But to the extent thai we can make sense of nonexistence as a positive attribute, it would have to be the attribute of something. And as we have seen-
￼328 THE TEXT :AND COMMENTARY
especially in Chapten VII, XXII, and XXIV-entities can only be conceived as dependent. So if something is nondependent, it can't also be a real nonexistent! In the next two venes, Niigiirjuna reframes the problem about the ontological status of nirviil)a in preparation for consideration of the       two tetralemma possibili- ties for nirval)a-that it is both existent and nonexistent and that it is neither existent nor nonexistent:
9. That which comes and goes Is dependent and changing.
That, when it is not dependent and changing, Is taught to be nirv31)a.
10. The teacher has spoken of relinquishing
Becoming and             
Therefore, it makes sense that
Nirv3Qa is neither existent nor nonexistent.
Nirva1,1a is here again explicitly characterized only by contrast with S81J1Siira. While it therefore cannot be an entity of the kind with which sa!Jlsiira is populated, it is, as the release from sa1J1siira, not completely nonexistent. So it can neither be conceived of conven- tionally or ultimately as a thing, nor coherently asserted not to exist. In fact, as XXV: 9 emphasizes with eloquence, the very same world is sa1J1siira or nirval)a, dependent upon one's penpective. When one perceives the constant arising and ceasing of phenomena, one per- ceives sa!Jlsiira. When all reification is abandoned, that world and one's mode of living init, becomes nirvii1,1a.127 Nagiirjuna now con- siders the possibility that nirval)a is both existent and nonexistent:
li. lf nirval)a were both Existent and noflexistent,
Passing beyond would, impossibly,
Be both existent and nonexistent.
This would entail that it is contradictory. And it is absurd to assign anything contradictory properties. Moreover, having seen
127. See Yuktfya.rtika 11 for         presentation of this view.
￼Examination ofNirviitJa
that each of the conjuncts is ir:tdividually impossible, their conjunc- tion, even were it not a conjunction of contradictories, could cer- tainly not be coherent. In particular, we don't want to say that one does and does not pass into nirvar:ia upon release from S31J1Siira.
12. If nirviil)a were both Existent and nonexistent,
Nhv81,1a would not be nondependent.
Since it would depend on both of these.
But since both existent and nonexistent entities are dependent, as Nagarjuna has argued in XXV: 6, 8, if nirviiQa were both exis- tent and nonexistent it would be doubly dependent. lt would de- pend both on existent and nonexistent phenomena.
13. How could nirviiQa
Be both existent and nonexistent?
Nirvaoa is uncompounded.
Both existents and nonexistents are compounded.
Moreover, not only are existents compounded-that is made up of parts or given rise to by causes-but genuine nonexistents are compounded as well-their nonexistence is determined by the na- ture of other things; if real, they wou\d be composed of parts. A nonexistent elephant is composed of a nonexistent trunk, tusks, and so forth.
14. How could        
Be both existent and nonexistent?
These two cannot be in the same place.
Like light and darkness.
This verse simply sums up the results of the previous three: There is simply no way to avoid manifest contradiction if one takes this horn of the tetralemma. Nagarjuna now considers the       possibility-that nirvar:ia is neither existent nor nonexistent: 12•

￼330 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
15. Nirviir.&gt;a is said to be
Neither existent nor nonexistent.
If the existent and the nonexistent were              This would be established
But this can't be so either. For really to assert this as the nature of nirval)a would be to suppose that both of these possibilities made sense with respect to it, but that neither happened to be realized. But it makes no sense for nirviil)a to exist. And it makes no sense for it not to exist. So of each, the negation can't be assigned any coherent meaning. And conjoining two pieces of non- sense only yields further nonsense.
16. If nirviil)a is
Neither existent nor nonexistent,
Then by whom is it expounded
"Neither existent nor nonexistent"?
If this could be coherently asserted, it would have to be asserted either by one in nirval)a or one not. But, as is emphasized in the next verse, this has never been asserted by anyone certifiably in nirval)a. And if it is asserted by someone il) satjlsara, we have no particular reason to believe it.
17. Having passed into nirvaoa, the Victorious Conqueror Is neither said to be existent
Nor said to be nonexistent. Neither both nor neither are said.
18. So, when the victorious one abides, he Is neither said to be existent
Nor said to be nonexistent. Neither both nor neither are said.
None of the four tetralemma possibilities can be asserted. Just as in Chapter XXII, we see that when things are plausibly posited by an interlocutor as ultimates, Nagarjuna resorts to a negative tetra- lemma. This emphasizes that all discourse is only possible from the conventional point of view. When we try to say something coherent
￼Examination of          331
about the nature of things frolli an ultimate standpoint, we end up talking nonsense. 129 But recall the discussion of emptiness and con- vention in chapter XXIV: We can develop an understanding of emptiness in relation to conventional reality, of emptiness as empty: Emptiness seen that way simply is the lack of essence of the conven- tional. lts own emptiness is the fact thai it itself is no more than that. Seeing the conventional as conventional, we argued, is to see it as it is ultimately. At this point, Nagarjuna makes a similar move with regard to nirviil;la and draws one of the most startling conclusions of the Mii/amadhyamakakiirikii: Just as there is no difference in entity between the conventional and the ultimate, there is no difference in entity between nirval)a and sarpsara; nirvana is simply samsara seen without reification, without attachment, without delusion. The rea- son thai we cannot say anything about nirval)a as an independent, nonsamsaric entity, then, is not that it is such an entity, but that it is ineffable and unknowable. no Rather it is because it is only samsara seen as it is, just as emptiness is just the conventional seen as it is:
19. There is not the slightest difference
Between cyclic existence and nirvól)a. There is not the slightest difference Between nirviQa and cyclic existence.
20. Whatever is the limit of nirv3IJa, That is the limit of cyclic existence,
There is not even the slightest difference between them, Or even the subtlest thing.
To distinguish between samsara and nirval)a would be to sup- pose that each bad a nature and that they were different natures. But cach is empty, and so there can be no inherent difference. Moreover, since nirval)a is by definition the cessation of delusion and of grasping and, hence, of the reification of self and other and of confusing imputed phenomena for inherently real phenomena,
129. See Nagao (1991), pp, 42-43, for a similar account.
130. This reading contrasts with that of lnada (1970), who asserts thai nirvaoa, in fact, is transcendent, belonging to a wholly different ontological realm. I find his reading very difficult to reconcile with XXV: 19, 20 or indeed, with any of Chapters XXII. XXIV, or XXV.
￼332 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
it is by definition the recognition of the ultimate nature of things. But if, as Niigiirjuna argued in Chapter XXIV, this is simply to see conventional things as empty, not to see some separate emptiness behind them, then nirvii.Qa must be ontologically grounded in the conventional. To be in samsara is to see things as they appear to deluded consciousness and to interact with them accordingly. Tu be in nirvii.Qa, then, is to see those things as they are-as merely empty, dependent, impermanent, and nonsubstantial, but not to be somewhere else, seeing something else.131
Another way of distinguishing between samsara and nirvii.Qa is to think of them somehow as different places, as Earth and Heaven are often conceived in Western religious traditions and then to think that upon attaining nirvii.Qa one leaves this place-disappears-and goes there. Of course, if one thinks at all about the career of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, that would entail that upon attaining enlightenment, he would have disappeared. This would make some- thing of a hash of the Buddhist canon. But Nii.garjuna is emphasizing that nirvii.Qa is not someplace else. lt is a way of being here.
Here is another way to put the somewhat paradoxical point: Niigiirjuna surely thinks that in nirvai:ia, unlike samsara, one per- ceives emptiness and not entities; one perceivesthe ultimate truth and not the conventional truth.132 But emptiness is only the empti-
131. Compare Streng (1973):
...[A] problem occurs when we act inappropriately to the empty (non-svabhiva) set of conditions that allow sarpskrta to arise. This inappropriateness is our acting as if we could discem a self-existent thing either in the oonditioned 'thing' or in somC identifiable 'element' of our experience. . . . Contrariwise, the insight that leads to the cessation of these inappropriate acts is an awareness that the condi- tions and relations by which we define Our experience are empty. (p. 30)
Nayak (1979) puts it this way: "Nirvd'JQ is thus nondifferent from critical insight par excellence which is free from all essentialist picture-thinking" (p. 489).
132. Though it is standard doctrine that a buddha, in virtue of being omni- scient (setting aside the vexed and controversial question of -the nature of this omniscience-a matter of considerable debate within Buddhist philosophy), per- ceives all conventional phenomena and knows all conventional truths, as well as all ultimate truths. But a buddha does not know conventional truths and perceive conventional phenomena in the same way that a nonenlightened being does. A buddha knows them and perceives them as conventional and sees them at the same time as empty, through an immediate knowledge of the unity of the two truths. A non-buddha, by contrast, even if s/he knows that conventional phenom-
￼Examination of NirviiP}a 333
ness of all entities, and the ultimate truth is merely the essenceless essence of ihose conventional things. So nirv3J)a is only sarpsiira experienced as a buddha experiences it. lt is the person who enters nirviir;ta, but as a state of being, not as a place to be. 133
21. Views that after cessation there is a limit, etc.,
And that it is permanent, etc., Depend upon nirvBl)a, the              And the prior limit.
The kind of metaphysical speculations that the Buddha discour- aged in the famous discussion of the unanswerable questions regard- ing the origins and limits of the world and what lies beyond the universe in space and time, are grounded, Nagarjuna asserts, in the view that cyclic existence-the entire phenomenal world-can be conceived as an entity against which stand other entities or other regions. This is the same kind of picture that motivates the view that nirvar;ia is someplace or something beyond cyclic existence or that nirviir;ta is bounded or eternal. But there is no vantage point from which the universe is one place among many. That is why talking aboutwhatliesbeyonditisnonsenseandwhyreifyingorcharacteriz- ing nirviir;ia temporally is one example of that nonsense.
22. Since all existents are empty,

What is finite and infinite?
What is neither finite nor infinite?

ena are empty, through studying Midhyamika philosophy, perceives them as inher- ently existent and only reasons her/himself into the knowledge that these phenom- ena are really empty and that these truths are merely conventional.
133. Kalupahana (1986) reads this verse differently. He translates it as follows: "Whatever is the extremity of freedom and the extremity of the life-process, be- tween them not cven asubtle something is evident." He then takcs the purport to be the denial of any entity such as a „seed of release" mediating between the states of sarrisdra and nirvdf}a (p. 367)
￼334 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Again Nagarjuna uses negative tetralemmas to emphasize that while of conventional entities a good deal can be said, so long as we take the predications to be asserted in a conventional, relative sense, the moment we try to conceive of things as they are ulti- mately, as empty, such assertion has to stop. That is not, again, to say that things are nonempty. Far from it. But it is to say that         description applies only within the bounds of conception and that attempts to develop a metaphysics of the ultimate are doomed.134
24. The pacification of all objectification And the pacification of          
No Dharma was taught by the Buddha
At any time, in any place, to any person.
In many Buddhist teachings many conventional phenomena are described and are subjected to analysis, including the mind, mental phenomena, and a wide range of extemal phenomena. But this is always a conventional analysis intended to demonstrate the empti- ness of these phenomena, their impermanent character, and so forth, for soteriological purposes. The goal is to dispel illusion and to end deluded ontological fabrication and the various epistemo- logical, psychological, and       ills Niigiirjuna has argued are grounded therein. But it is important, Niigiirjuna concludes, not to reify that doctrine, or any of the entities thai appear as prima facie referents of the words used to expound it (the Buddha, the spiri- tual community, etc.,). In fact, it is important to see that nirviii:ia does not, on this account, amount to an entity; it is not achieved or described by entities. Rather it is a way of engagement with nonen- tities by nonentities.
134. Padhye (1988) points out (pp. 68-70) that Nigirjuna should also be read here and in this chapter as a whole as emphasizing that, in virtue of the emptiness of all phenomena in SaftZSdra and of the self that experiences them, nirvd„a, which is defined        as that        Jiberation from positing those phenomena, musr be equally empty. For it, too, can only be understood as a characteristic of that empty self and of its          to empty phenomena.
￼Chapter XXVI Examination of the Twelve Links
Given an analysis of the nature of nirvai:ia, one might well ask how to achieve it. In this chapter. Niigiirjuna provides a straightforward answer. The twelve links of dependent origination are regarded by all Buddhist schools as providing an analysis of the nature of inter- dependence in the context of human existence. The tone of this chapter is decidedly positive, marking the tuming of a dialectical corner in the preceding two chapters. Having elucidated the Miidhyamika account of the nature of ct&gt;nventional and ultimate reality, Niigiirjuna does not need at this point so much to empha- size the emptiness of the twelve links. Rather he can assume that to provide an account of them as dependently arisen is, ipso facto, to demonstrate that fact. Their emptiness is therefore simply presup- posed. This chapter is thus a straightforward exposition of how, in light of the interdependence of the twelve links, to enter into and to exploit the cycle in the service of liberation.
I. Wrapped in the darkness of ignorance, One performs the three kinds of actions Which as dispositions impel one
To continue to future existences.
One is caught in cyclic existence for a reason, Niigiirjuna asserts, because one acts. There are three general kinds of actions distin-

guished in Buddhist action theory-physical, verbal, and mental. These actions in turn have immediate psychological consequences for the agent. That is, they give rise to new psychological disposi- tions. In the framework of Buddhist action theory, these disposi- tions are themselves conceived of as actions existing in a potential form, and of course when actualized, they emerge as new actions of body, speech, or mind. These in turn lead to a variety of new such consequences and to the continuation of cyclic existence.m Transmigration-the continuation of saQJsara-for Nagarjuna is then simply a dependent consequence of one's actions.
2. Having dispositions as its conditions, Consciousness enters transmigration.
Once consciousness has entered transmigration, Name and form come to be.
Continuing through the traditional presentation of the twelve links, Nagarjuna notes that consciousness is a consequence of dis· positions and depends upon them and that "name and form" fol- low as a consequence of consciousness. These, therefore, are obvi· ously also dependent phenomena.
There are two ways to think of the twelve links, generating two          circles of explan!tion: One can approach them from the standpoint of transmigration, which provides a standard Buddhist explanation of the cycle of life. Or one can think of them as provid· ing a phenomenological analysis of the nature of experience. In the former sense, we could say at this point in the story that actions performed in the past and dispositions inherited from one's previ· ous bistory lead to new actions whose consequences are cyclic existence. In particular, the actions and dispositions from one's prior life, on this view, lead to the generation of a new conscious- ness, which upon entering the womb, gives rise to a body that will get a particular name.
Or, from a phenomenological perspective, we can see disposi· tions to attend to or to interpret particular phenomena in certain
135. The term "las" (Skt: karma) hence refers both to action and to the conse· quences of action for the individual.
￼Examination of the TWelve Links 337
ways (perceptual or conceptual "sets") and actions upon them lead- ing to our becoming aware of external or internal phenomena (con- sciousness), which leads to our representing them as having determi- nate locations and denominations (name and form). These two levels of analysis are obviously quite compatible, and while the former plays a central role in Buddhist cosmological and soteriological theory, the latter is important in Buddhist psychology and practice.
3. Once name and form come to be,
The six sense spheres come into being. Depending on the six sense spheres, Contact comes into being.
From the ontogenetic side, the development of the body gives     to the development of the sense faculties, which make sensation-contact between sense objects and functioning sense organs-possible. From the phenomenological point of view, we can say thai the domain of perceptibles and the structure of percep- tual experience and knowledge depends upon our ability to repre- sent and individuate objects, and thai sensory contact is sensory contact in the first place only in virtue of its role in experience, which is in tum dependent upon the entire perceptual process. Tu put the matter crudely, an amputated sense organ in contact with an object is hardly in contact in the appropriate way.
4. Thai is only dependent
On eye and form and apprehension. Tuus, depending on name and form, And which produces consciousness---
The first two lines emphasize thai contact-that is, the initial relation between the sense organ and its object-has three neces- sary and sufficient conditions: sense organ, the object, and the cognitive state to which the sense organ gives     (apprehension/ dran byed). The last two lines are continuous with the next verse:
5. That which is assembled from the three--
Eye and form and consCiousness,
￼338 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY Is contact. From contact
Feeling comes to be.
lt is important to note thai this occurrence of "consciousness" (rnam-par shes-pa) in fact refers to the apprehension of the previ- ous verse, which is in Buddhist psychology a form of conscious- ness. But it should not be confused with the consciousness whose condition is contact, on pain of a hopeless explanatory tangle. Contact, as we have seen, is dependent upon the existence of the organ, the object, and the functioning of the sense faculty. Depen- dent upon thai contact is sensation. The exposition here is per- fectly traditional. lt only derives its punch from the context: In light of the connection thai has been developed between the depen- dence thai is central to this model and emptiness, the entire Theravada model of the nature of the phenomenal world comes to look like an analysis in terms of emptiness.
6. Conditioned by feeling is craving.
Craving arises because of feeling.
When it appears, tbere is grasping, The four spheres of grasping.
Pleasurable sensations lead to craving; painful ones lead to crav- ing for their end. Thai craving leads to grasping-an attempt to appropriate and make one's own the source of pleasure or the means for the alleviation of pain, and to excessive valuation of the grasped object. The four spheres probably denote the four realms- the desire, the form, the formless, and the pure, entities in each of which could be the objects of grasping.
7. When there is grasping, the grasper
Comes into existence.
l f he did not grasp,
Then being freed, he would not come into existence.
The identity of the individual as a grasper-and hence as a deluded actor in the world and an agent of the continuation of saIPSiira-depends upon this grasping. As Niigiirjuna argued in Chapters VI and XVI, without grasping, there is no grasper.

8. This existence is also the live aggregates.
From existence comes birth,
Old age and death and misery and          and grief and . . .
9. Confusion and agitation.
All these      as a consequence of birth. Thus this entire mass of suffering
Comes into being.
But moreover, the account that emerges so far of the nature of human existence-one involving a body, sensations, perception, dispositions, and consciousness-is just the account of personal existence in terms of the five aggregates into which standard Bud- dhist psychology analyzes the person. So this account so far is an account of the conditions that give rise to human existence. But human existence gives rise to human births, and these eventually give rise to aging, to pain and           and eventually to death and the consequent grief of one's loved ones. This part of the story, of course, is central to making the case for the first two noble truths.
We are born with dispositions to reify, to crave, and to grasp, all of which, on this analysis, lead directly to             the pain of wanting what we cannot have, of not wanting what we do have, of grasping onto permanence in an impermanent world, of cherishing our own existence and interests in a world where they are minor affairs, and of grasping for independence and freedom in a condi- tioned universe.
10. The root of cyclic existence is action.
Therefore, the wise one does not act.136
136. "'du byed" (Skt.: samskdra). This term is often translated in this text as "disposition." It can also mean "to compound„ or "compounded phenomenon." Here it must function as a verb. Both Streng (1967) and lnada (1970) prefer the reading "to compound„ or "to oonstruct." But given Nigirjuna's theory of action, as we have scen, dispositions and actions are of a kind. And what generates the karma that creates and maintains cyclic existence is action. Hence, I read the term here as denoting action and disposition together, via its primary meaning, "disposi- tion." This receives further support from the use of the nominal "byed-po," which is oognate with the compound " 'du byed" and is most· naturally translated as "agent."
￼340 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY Therefore, the unwise is the agent.
The wise one is not because of his insight.
The place to pick up the tangle in order to unravel it, from the standpoint of practice, Niigiirjuna suggests, is with action and dis- position, here comprised together under the single term "action" ('du byed), which in this context conveys not only the unity of action and disposition as seen from the soteriological point of view, but also their role in creating or bringing about future existence. These are most easily controlled through philosophical refiection, through meditation, and through assiduous practices of various virtues. By changing the way that we act physically, verbally, and mentally, we thereby change the way that we perceive, think, and act and thereby change what we see and the consequences of our actions.
11. With the cessation of ignorance Action will not arise.
The cessation of ignorance occurs through
Meditation and wisdom.
But in order really to modify our actions and dispositions to act, we need wisdom-in this context an understanding of the real nature of things, which for Niigiirjuna means the view of all things as empty. This view, Niigiirjuna asserts, must be intemalized through meditation, so thai it becomes not merely a philosophical theory that we can reason our way into, but the basie way in which we take up with the world. Accomplishing that, he asserts, leads to the cessation of that activity responsible for the perpetuation of the suffering of sa111siira. ·
12. Through the cessation of this and that This and thai will not be manifest.
It is important, however, to bear in mind that Nigirjuna is discussing actions and d i s p o s i t i o n s t o g e t h e r a s a u n i t a r y p h e n o m e n o n a n d t h i n k i n g o f t h e m - a s t h e          tions of Inada and Sprung bring to the fore-as that which constructs or creates our future existence. dGe           agrees with this reading, as does Je Tsong Khapa. I am indebted to the Ven. Sherab Gyatso for convincing me of this.
￼Examination ofthe 1We/ve Links 341 The entire mass of suffering
Indeed thereby completely ceases.
And this is not      the          Niigiirjuna offers of the world and of our experience of it, but his                     recommenda- tion given the doctrine of the emptiness of all phenomena. Human existence and experience are indeed governed by the              of dependent origination. But since they are             depen- dent, they are             empty and, hence, are impermanent and subject to change. The              provide an anatomy and an          of suffering. But by understanding their impermanence and dependency, we      see the cure for !hat condition. For by             a elear and accurate               view of the nature of things-the view so                        in Chapter XXIV, by               that view, and by taking up with the world in accor- dance with it, we can cease the reification of the "this" and the "that," grasping for which binds us to suffering. Niigiirjuna argues that if we can achieve that, we can achieve the nirviina character- ized in Chapter XXV-a nirviii:ia not found in an escape from the world but in an             and awakened engagement with it.
￼Chapter XXVII Examination of Views
The       chapter of the text, like the previous chapter, applies the results of the climactic analyses of Chapters XXIV and XXV. It is noteworthy that all of the classic erroneous views discussed and refuted in this chapter are refuted earlier in the text. lndeed, Chap- ters XXIV and XXV are immediately preceded by a chapter on errors. One might therefore think that this chapter is otiose, or at least misplaced. For here Niigiirjuna considers a range of alterna- tive metaphysical views confticting with Niigiirjuna's analysis in terms of emptiness. These views are all well-known and considered false by all schools of Buddhist philosophy. So why does Niigiirjuna return to them as a collection at the close of the text?
The previous chapter demonstrated the positive payoff of the analysis of emptiness and its relation to conventional phenomena. Niigiirjuna there argued that one can exploit emptiness and an understanding of emptiness in following the path to nirviil)a. But the pursuit of the path entails the elimination of error. In fact, it can negatively be               as we saw in the nirviil)a chapter, specifically as the elimination of error. So it is important for Niigiirjuna to show that the analysis developed in XXIV and XXV can not only promote positive movement toward nirviil)a but also the eradication of the erroneous views that bind us to SaQlsiira. Thai is the burden of this       chapter. It is also important dialecti- cally to see that Niigiirjuna is demonstrating that the root of all of
￼Examination of Views 343
these erroneous views is the view that the self or the external world exist inherently. Jf, he will argue, one grants either of those claims, one is stuck with one or more of these errors. lt therefore follows thai any view, including any view of any other Buddhist school- including:an of the schools thai castigate these views on indepen- dent grounds-that posits inherently existent entities will succumb to these errors. Niigiirjuna thus concludes by arguing not only that his position is capable of leading to           but thai it is the only position capable of doing so.
1. The views "in the past I was" or "I was not" · And the view that the world is permanent, etc., All of these views
Depend on a prior limit.
Niigiirjuna summarizes the .diagnosis he will offer of the error underlying these metaphysical views: Any view that the self is permanent or nonexistent or thai the world is permanent or nonex- istent presupposes that one can think coherently about the begin- ning of time or of identity. For to think of things as permanent requires us either to posil a beginning of time from which they existed or to assert that time has no beginning. To think thai there was a past at which the self did not exist or in which the world did not exist presupposes that we can mark a point at which the world carne into existence or at which there is a definite separation be- tween a world without the self and a world with the self-an initial moment of personal existence.
2. The view "in the future I will become other" or "I will not do
so"
And that the world is limited, etc.,
All of these views Depend on a       limit.
Similarly, such views require us to be able to talk coherently about the end of the world or the end of personal existence-to be able to speak of a future time where nothing exists, or of the end of time, or of an unlimited future existence or of a definite moment
￼344 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
when the self ceases to exist, whereas before it bad existed. Niigiirjuna begins by discussing arguments regarding the self, open- ing with a set of arguments for the permanence of the self:

What existed in the past
Is not identical to this one.
It is a fundamental confusion to think that because I can say that I or someone or something else existed in the past that there is a real identity between what exists now and what existed then. Iden- tity requires that we share all properties, and that is trivially impos- sible over time. But any assertion of the permanence of the self requires that we be able to identity it over time.
4. According to you, this self is thai, But the appropriator is different.
If it is not the appropriator,
What is your self!
Suppose that one through introspection or analysis takes some putative entity-one's body, one's stream of consciousness, or whatever-to be one's self. There will be in that act a duality of appropriator and the thing appropriated as the self or as part of the self. But at different times what is appropriated and what is appro- priating differ. Both subject and object will necessarily be distinct. But in order to posit the appropriating entity as the self, it most retain its identity over time. The sequence of appropriators hence fails to provide a candidate for a continuing self. But, Niigiirjuna points out, there is no other candidate.
5. Having shown that there is no self Other than the appropriator,
The appropriator should be the self. But it is not your self.
The self that is posited by the advocate of a permanent self is a substantial entity capable of grasping, not a mere evanescent activ-
￼Examlnation o f Views 345
ity. So it cannot be the appropriator. Moreover, Nagiirjuna points out in the next verse, the same argument applies, mutatis mutandis, to the act of appropriation. To identify that with the selfwould be to identify agent and action:
6. Appropriating is not the self.
It arises and ceases.
How can one accept thai
Future appropriating is the appropriator?
1\vo problems are developed in this verse: First of all, the self that the reificationist wishes to posit is a permanent, enduring self. But appropriating is a momentary action that arises and ceases constantly with new objects of appropriation. A sequence of such actions is hardly a substantial subject. This is a straightforwardly Humean argument. Second, Niigiirjuna points out, even if one argued that the self was substantial and also identical to that se- quence, there is a further difficulty: The self that is posited by this interlocutor is an enduring subject of these acts·of appropriation. But some of the members of the sequence have yet to come into existence. If the self exists entirely at all moments of time, as an unchanging substantial subject, it cannot be identified with a se- quence, some of whose members are not presently existent.
7. A self thai is different
From the appropriating is not         
If it were different, then in a nonappropriator There should be appropriation. But there isn't.
This is a very obscure argument as it is put in the text, but given the context we can       it out: The target position here is one according to which the existence of appropriation as a real, persis- tent feature of cyclic existence is used as the basis for attributing personal identity to a continuing self. That self is not supposed to be the appropriating itself, but rather a separate entity indepen- dent of it. Niigiirjuna points out, though, that it is, and for the proponent of this view, it must be possible not to appropriate- otherwise nirvai:ia would be impossible. So, there will be a
￼346 ffiE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
nonappropriator who once was an appropriator. But if appropria- tion is the basis of the identity of the one who has been liberated with the one who was not, thai appropriation should persist in the nonappropriator, which would be contradictory.
8. So it is neither different from the              Nor identical to the              
There is no self without appropriation. But it is not true that it does not exist.
Tuus we cannot use the existence of appropriation as a basis on which to construct a permanent self. For thai self cannot be both permanent and identified with such a constantly changing activity. But stili, that is all there is to the self. This raises the possibility that it would be correct to say that the self does not persist at a l l - that there is no existent person in any sense. It is to this view that Niigiirjuna now tums. He first announces the conclusion-that it is not correct to say that the person who now exists did not exist in the past. There is a sense in which thai person is identical with his/ her past stages:
9. To say "in the past I wasn't" Would not be tenable.
This person is not different
From whoever existed in previous times.
10. If this one were different,
Then if that one did not exist. I would stili exist. lf this were so,
Without death, one would be bom.
If there were a genuine difference in entity between the current stage and the previous stages 'of a person, they would be indepen- dent. If that were so, the current stage-since if il depends on anything, depends on the previous stage-would come into exis- tence depending on nothing. Thai is, it would be possible for none of my previous stages to exist, but for me, as the person with my past, to pop into existence ex nihilo. Or, on the other hand, it would be possible, if the current stage and previous stages were
￼Examination ofViews 347
completely different and independent, for the current stage to come into existence without the previous stage having passed out of existence, which is absurd.
Il. Annihilation and the exhaustion of action would         Different agents' actions
Would be experienced by each other. Thai and other such things would        
We could make no sense of the actual empirical fact of conven- tional personal identity; action done at one moment would be done by one person, and that person would experience none of its conse- quences. To the extent that we could make sense of them at all, the phenomena of memory and experiencing the consequences of one's previous actions would become interpersonal affairs, which seems at least a bit odd.
12. Nothing comes to exist from something that did not exist. From this errors would arise.
The self would be produced
Or, existing, would be without a cause.
Moreover, since the past, as per the discussion of time in Chap- ter XIX and the discussion of dependent origination in VII, does not          exist, we would have the consequence of an existent (the present person) being brought into existence dependent upon something that no longer exists (some past person). Anything that exists has some past.
13. So, the views "I existed," "I didn't exist," Both or neither,
In the past Are untenable.
While Niigiirjuna has not expllcitly considered the "both" or "neither" horns of the tetralemma, we have seen enough of these arguments by this stage to know how to complete the picture. Since neither a             existent nor a discontinuous self makes sense, both can't make sense since that would just be double non'
￼348 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
sense. And the "neither" option is not open since there is no third alternative. Niigiirjuna now points out thai the argument applies straightforwardly to the future existence of the self:
14. To say "In the future I will exist or
Will not exist,"
Such a view is like Those involving the past.
Another possible avenue to a permanent self is the classical Indian view (not unlike certain Judeo-Christian views) thai the human soul partakes of the divine, and thai its divinity is what engenders its eternality:
15. I f a human were a god,
On such a view there would be permanence. The god would be unborn.
For any permanent thing is·unborn.
16. I f a human were different from a god,
On such a view there would be impermanence. I f the human were different from the god,
A continuum would not be tenable.
But if the human is at all different from a god, as is eminently plausible (i.e., nobody          argues that humans simply are gods), then the permanence of the divine in no way entails the permanence of the person. There is another possibility, however, namely thai the person is part divine and part mortal:
17. I f one part were divine and One part were human,
It would be both permanent and impermanent. Thai would be irrational.
The problem with this option ·is thai either we say thai the per- son is both permanent and impermanent, which is contradictory, or thai the divine part is permanent and the mortal part imperma- nent. But if the person is a              sum of these two parts,
￼Examination of Views 349
then since there is an impermanent part, the whole is constantly changing and the inherent identity of the person from moment to moment is stili lost.
18. If il could be eslablished thai
It is both permanent and impermanent, Theo it could be established thai
It is neither permanent nor impermanent.
That is, the "both" and "neither" horns of the tetralemma stand or fali together. Permanence and impermanence are mutually ex- clusive and exhaustive alternatives. They can neither be co-present, nor co-absent. (The option of asserting them in different voices- conventional and ultimate-is not open to the opponent here, who is trying to defend an inherently existent self.)
19. If anyone had come from anyplace And were then to go someplace,
It would follow that cyclic existence was beginningless. 'fhis is not the case.
As Niigiirjuna has argued, if there were to be true identity through time, so that the person who exists now is literally identi- cal to one who existed in the past and to one who will exist in the future, this would have to be in virtue of sharing some essence. But this would make real change impossible. The person, once in samsiira, would be there essentially-the state of being in samsiira would hence be inherently existent. (Here Niigiirjuna is using the term "beginningless" as a synonym for "inherently existent.") If samsiira were inherently existent, it would have to be eternal and unchanging. Nirviil)a would be unattainable, and samsiira would be utterly hopeless. But given the possibility of transformation, it follows that such         identity must be abandoned.
20. If nolhing is permanen1, What will be impermanent,
Permanent and impermanent, Or neither?
￼350 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
Finally, given thai there are no permanent entities, no entities, from the ultimate point of view, can serve as inherent bases of predication. Thai is, the views thai Niigiirjuna has been consider- ing regarding the nature of the self, which purport to give its ultimate nature, musi all be seen as incoherent on that ground alone-namely, that they propose an ultimate analysis. Niigiirjuna now turns his attention to views not about the self, per se, but about the world as a whole:
21. If the world were limited,
How could there be another world'!
If the world were unlimited,
How could there be another world?
Niigiirjuna begins by questioning the sense of the question re- garding the limits of the world: lt seems to be like a question about the size of a table. But it is not. lt is not, thai is, a question about whether there is anything beyond the world. For suppose that the world is limited. Thai suggests that there is some.thing beyond it. But thai just means thai we haven't come to the end of the world. The whole world includes thai stuff that lies beyond. Or suppose thai the world is unlimited. Thai suggests thai there is nothing beyond the world. But that just means that everything thai is in the world is, in fact, in the world, which is trivia!. The question ·regarding the limits of the world, so Niigiirjuna suggests, is nonsensical.
22. Since the continuum of the aggregatcs Is like the flame of a butterlamp,
It follows that neither its finitude
Nor its infinitude makes sense.
In this discussion, Niigiirjuna is focusing on the tempora! limits of the world. Again, the question regarding whether the world has tempora! limits presupposes that it is a single eolity thai either exists forever or that passes out of existence. But the world, Niigiirjuna suggests, is more like a ftame. lt is a series of distinct ftickering events. While each event is momentary, the sequence
￼Examination of Views 351 continues. But there is no entity that persists and can be said to be
etemal or momentary.
23. lf the previous were disintegrating And these aggregates, which depend
Upon those aggregates, did not arise,
Then the world would be finite.
We could say that the world is finite if its current state simply ceased and nothing else arose. But absent that, there is no basis for positing an end, and dependent origination argues against positing an end to the world in time.
24. If the previous were not disintegrating
And these aggregates, which depend
Upon those aggregates, did not arise,
Then the world would be infinite.
On the other hand, the world would be infinite if it reached a stage where its current state became permanent. But again, given the nature of dependent arising, this is not a likely eventuality.
25. I f one part were finite and One part were infinite,
Then the world would be finite and infinite. This would make no sense.
Niigiirjuna now makes use of the argument mobilized at XXVII: 17. The world cannot have these contradictory properties any more than an individual can.
26. How could one think thai
One part of the appropriator is destroyCd And one part is not destroyed?
This position makes no sense.
27. How could one think thai
One part of the appropriation is destroyed
And one part is not destroyed?
This position makes no sense.
￼352 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
The appropriator here is the self; the appropriation, the exis- tence of the world. Nagarjuna in these two verses is summing up and drawing together the conclusions of the two main arguments in the chapter. We want to say on the one hand that neither the world nor the self is permanent. Both are thoroughly characterized by impermanence. On the other hand, we want to say of both that they endure in time and of each that there is no fixed boundary to its identity. But it can't be that either has both of these properties.
28. l f it e&lt;mld be established that It is both finite and infinite,
Then it could be established that It is neither finite nor infinite.
This verse echoes XXVII: 18. If either the self or the world could be conceived as both finite and infinite; finitude and infini- tude would make no sense at all. They are contradictory properties and cannot             the same thing at the same time. More- over, they are exhaustive altematives.
29. So, because all entities are empty,
Which views of permanence, etc., would occur,
And to whom, when, why, and about what Would they occur at all?
But if we bear in mind the emptiness of all phenomena, on the subject and on the object side, these views do not even      as                The self and all of the phenomena in the world itself, being empty, are                    conventional phenomena. Their emptiness itself is             arisen and empty. There is no candidate for permanence. There is no candidate for ultimate impermanence. And to the extent that we grasp and live this truth, there is no one to stand over and against the world as "I" against "it."
30. I prostrate to Gautama Who through compassion Taught the true doctrine,
Which leads to the relinquishing of all views.
￼Examination ofViews 353
The most common interpretation of this fina! verse has the phrase "all views" (Tib: lta-ba thams-cad, Skt: sarva-dH{i) refer- ring to all false views, thai is, all views according to which things have inherent existence.137 These, after all, are the views under examination and refutation in this chapter. And it is the elear purport of this chapter thai these views are the principal hin- drances to enlightenment and the causes of attachment to cyclic existence. On this reading, Nagarjuna exempts his own view and therefore the Madhyamika understanding of the Buddhist doc- trine, which Nagarjuna here reminds us was taught compassion- ately explicitly to enable the rejection of these ·views. That doc- trine, or standpoint, on this reading, is not to be relinquished. Indeed, one might say, it is not even a "view" in the relevant sense since a view must be a view of something, and the analysis in terms of emptiness reveals a world with no entities to view. This interpre- tation is urged unanimously by all of the commentaries with which I am familiar and by many of the scholars with whom I have consulted.
137. This, for instance, is the view urged unanimously by Je-Tsong Khapa (pp. 477-84), mKhas-grub-rje (pp. 112-17), and dGe-'dun-grub (p, 237) and by most    the Geluk-pa scholars with whom I have consulted. Whether Candrakirti or Aryadeva read the text this way is unclear. On the other hand, many Nyingma scholars adopt the altemative reading I suggest herc. In conversation, H.H. the Dalai Lama has suggested to me that the Geluk-pa interpretation may make the most sense from the standpoint of philosophy and for the purposes of characterizing an inferentiaJ understanding of emptiness, but that the Nyingma understanding may provide a better expression of the nature ot the direct understanding of emptiness and may be more useful for guiding meditative practice. The Ven. Prof. Oeshe Yeshes Thap-Khas, on the other hand       c.ommentary), suggests that the two interpretations are both intended-the first as the teaching regarding the conven- tional truth, and appropriate for those not yet advanced in meditative·practice. and the second as a teaching regarding the nature of the direct realization of emptiness experienced by a buddha at enlightenment, and by advanced practitioners in medita- tive equipoise directly realizing emptiness. Huntington· (1989), pp. 119-22, presents a elear and compelling discussion of such direct realization. He writes of the differ- ence between a dualistic and nondualistic awareness ot the world:
The difference is one of attitude, for all else remains as it was. Similarly, when the bodhisattva cultivates non-dualistic knowledge he both sees and sees through the natural interpretations that structure his world. He sees nothing new or different, but he knows, directly and incorrigibly, that all the elements of experi- ence are dependent upon one another and upon the nature of the perceiving consciousness in a very profound and             way. (p. 122)
￼354 THE TEXT AND COMMENTAJlY
But there is a second reading available, not instead of, but in addition to, the standard reading.138 There is a startling grammati- cal and poetic parallel between this closing verse and the dramatic dedicatory verses. Both have the form, if translated literally, al- most preserving Tibetan word order, "To bim who ... To that [great one/Gautam] I prostrate" (gang gis . .. dam-pa/go-dam de la phyag-'tshal Io). The echo at the end of the opening is apparent, and it draws attention to Nagarjuna's denial in the dedication of the possibility of any predication from the ultimate point of view- of the inability to say anything positive thai is literally true about the ultimate nature of things. When this is joined with our reading of such verses as XVIII: 7,9; XXII: 11, 12, 15; XXIV: 18; and XXV: 23-all of which emphasize in different ways the impossibil- ity of         statements about the ultimate and the merely osten- sive character of language about it, despite the need for such con- ventional assertion to enable one to approach ultimate truth-we can see a double entendre in this verse. For, if one reads it not from the conventional point of view as in the previous interpreta- tion, but as an echo of the dedication, one can see Nagarjuna's own view and the Buddhist Dharma itself included under "all views" and, hence, necessarily to be relinquished once it is under- stood and used. And compare especially XIII: 8:
8. The victorious ones have said
That emptiness is the relinquishing of all.views. For whomever emptiness is a view,
Thai one has accomplished oothiog.
We can now return to this verse with more of Nagarjuna's analy- sis available: For the practicioner who directly realizes emptiness, nothing is present to consciousness but emptiness itself. For such a
138, Both the Most Ven. Khamtrul Rinpoche and the Most Ven. Samdhong Rinpoche emphatically support the second reading as the primary meaning of the verse and as the       expression of the emptiness of emptiness (personal communi- cation). !nada (1970) waffl.es. In his commentary {p. 164), he endorses the "all views" reading. But in his translation (p. 171), he inserts "false" parenthetically before "views." These are clearly not consistent moves. Ng (1993) also agrees with the "false view" reading. See pp. 18-20.
￼Examination of Views 355
consciousness, there literally is no object since there is in such a consciousness no reification of the kind thai gives rise to subject- object duality. Moreover, since such a consciousness is directed only upon what can be found ultimately to exist and since nothing can be so found, there is literally nothing toward which such a consciousness can be directed. But this very fact is what is ostended by the dictum thai emptiness is itself empty: Emptiness is not the real object as opposed to the unreal objects of ordinary perception, not the object thai appears when false appearance is shed. In fact, to the extent that it appears as an object at all, it does so as falsety asany table. If so, the best we can then say is thai from sucha standpoint the words "emptiness is empty" ascribe no prop- erty to any object at all. From thai standpoint, there is no view to be expressed, where a view is something thai can be given asser- toric voice. For a view is possible if, and only if, (1) there is something to view and (2) there is some way in which it is viewed.
That is, first, if it were possible to have a (true) view about emptiness, emptiness would have to be a thing-an object of awareness. But if we supposed thai it is, a dilemma emerges: Emp- tiness musi then exist either conventionally or ultimately. The lat- ter, as we have seen, is impossible since then it would fai\ itself to be empty and not only would a central tenet of Madhyamilra phi- losophy be contradicted, but the remainder would be rendered incoherent as well. But positing emptiness as a conventional exis- tent and as the object of a correct view is no better, for things thai appear conventionally appear as entities.:_as phenomena that exist independently and substantially. And all such appearance is, from the standpoint of Madhyamika, in an important sense,fa/se appear- ance. To pul this point another way, true predication is always predication from a perspective in which the subject of the predi- cate exists and within which the predicate can be instantiated. For conventional entities, the conventional standpoint provides such a perspective. But for emptiness, neither the conventional nor the ultimate standpoint can do the job: In the conventional standpoint, there is no emptiness; in the ultimate standpoint there are no entities at all.
Now lei us consider the second entailment-that concerning the manner in which emptiness wÓuld need to be viewed. Views are
￼356 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
views of things under             and, hence, are views of things as having some nature. I view this paper as paper, as white, as a bearer of print, as a product of a tree, and so forth. And again, so long as I am               a conventional entity as it is viewed from the conventional perspective, there is no problem here. But when we attempt to extend this analysis to emptiness itself, problems arise. For the            of                        under which things can be viewed-again requires the existence of the substrata and the p o s s i b i l i t y o f t h e i r s e r v i n g a s p r o p e r t y b e a r e r s , a s      a s t h e d u a l i s m between substratum and property this presupposes. The perspec- tive from which this continued existence and this dualism are avail- able is the conventional perspective for it is only conventions that bring ontology inio play. But again, in thai perspective, we don't find emptiness; we find all kinds of entities, but we find them as entities and, hence, as nonempty. But from the perspective in which we find emptiness, we don't find any entities orany                 not even emptiness itself or the fact of its emptiness. Hence again, since we can't view emptiness even as empty, in view of its very emptiness, we can't have a view of emptiness. This point is made pithily in a verse quoted by Niigiirjuna in his autocommentary to the Vigrahavyiivartanf: "By their nature, the things are not a determi- nate entity. For they have only one nature, i.e. no nature" (                Prajniipiiramitii-siitra).
This reading of the concluding verse, and by implication of the related verses we have noted (particularly XIII: 8), would not entail any self-refutation or any denial of the need at the conven- tional level for the assertion of Buddhist doctrine or the         articulated by Niigiirjuna in Miilamadhyamakakiirikii. On the con- trary, this interpretation would be consistent with the raft meta- phor popular in Buddhist philosophy (one discards the raft after one has crossed the river; it would be foolish to continue to carry it overland; similarly, Buddhist teachings are soteriological in intent and are to be discarded after their goal has been attained) or the laxative metaphor of the Ratnakuta-siitra mobilized by Candrakirti in his comments on XIII: 8 and Sextus (one wants the medicine to be          along with the pathogenic bowel contents) used to discourage grasping even to the Dharma. Hence Niigiirjuna ac- knowledges that, having announced in the dedication that nothing
￼Examination o f Views 357
can be said       about the       nature of things and having de- fended this thesis              in the text, his words and those of the Buddha cannot even be taken as literally true about the       nature of things. Hence in order to realize thai nature, one must relinquish even a          nonostensive reading of these texts.139
139. The Ven. Prof. Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas       commentary) points out that emptiness as it appears in direct realization does not appear as an entity (ngos- po). From the ultimate point of view there areno entities. Since a view is always a view of an entity, in direct realization of emptiness, there is a necessary relinquish- ing of all views, including all Buddhist and all Midhyamika views. But, he argues, it does not follow that one not directly rcalizing emptiness can relinquish all views or, in particular, that one should relinquish true ones. Insofar as direct realization of emptiness is a primary goal of Buddhist practice, he argues, and especially of the practice of Buddhist philosophy, it is hence appropriate to. read this verse in this way as well as in the more conventional way.
1be Ven. Geshe Yeshe Topden (also in      commentary) puts this a bit differ- ently: Emptiness, he argues, when it is known inferentially, is known as a positive phenomenon and appears as an inherently existent entity, even though the subject of such a oognition knows that it is not so (compare a mirage that appears as water even to someone who knows that it is merely a mirage). And in order to realize emptiness in this way, one must make use of the Midhyamika view while rejecting all false views. To one who directly apprehends emptiness, however, he claims, emptiness, while an object of such an awareness, is not a positive phenomenon, but a mere negation of all positive phenomena and is not different in entity from the mind cognizing it. In such an awareness, he claims, since emptiness does not appear as qualified in any way and since such an awareness is nonconceptual, there is no view of emptiness. So, he argues, even the Midhyamika view is to be relinquished at the stage of direct realization. Nonetheless, the verse indicates first, on his reading, the necessity to relinquish all false views, and then, in direct realization to relinquish the Midhyamika view.
Mukherjee (1985) makes a similar point:
A significant point that the Mcidhyamikas never fail to make out is that reason and concepts have a place in Vyavahdra. lt is possible to select a pattem, hold a position without clinging to it, i.e., without being dogmatic. It teaches one to look at a view as something relative and shows that the error of clinging is not essential to reason. . . . Did not the Buddha himself use words, concepts without clinging to them? .. .
By being free of clinging one attains a level that is transcendent to all the views, but at the same time he remains fully cognisant of the other levels in their minutest details without losing sight of the undivided reality. He sees these levels as not yet perfect; he sees them as various stages on the way to the perfect." (pp. 221-22)
See also Kalupahana (1986), p. 80. But Kalupahana also says that these final lines "clearly show that Nagarjuna was aware that the Buddha did not speak 'meta- physically' but only 'empirically'" (p. 391). That conclusion certainly does not follow. To refuse to give a metaphysical theory of the nature of phenomena and to
￼358 THE TEXT AND COMMENTARY
One must realize the ultimate truth dependent upon the conven- tional, but abandon all of these necessarily conventional designa- tions as characterizations of an ultimate nature that is ultimately uncharacterizable.140
The anticipation of Wittgenstein's close of the Tractatus is remarkable:
6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: any- one who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used thCm-as steps-to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder alter he has climbed up it.)
7 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
Niigiirjuna may well have intended (and of course we have no way of knowing what he intended, nor would it make much differ- ence to interpretation at this point) both readings-the standard reading at the conventional level, according to which the truth of his own standpoint contrasts with all other false views, and this latter reading at the ultimate level, at which his own view must itself be seen as a merely conventional ostention of an ineffable ultimate truth.141 And if the doctrine of the two truths and their identity is correct, these readings are          entailing. To assert
refuse to characterize what cannot be spoken of coherently does not by itself con- stitute an eschewal of metaphysics. Nor does it indicate that the arguments offered in this text are empirical. Manifestly, a great deal of metaphysics (albeit of a highly critical and negative kind) and very little empirical discussion occur in this text.
140. Wood (1994) argues, following his nihilistic interpretation of Nagarjuna, that here and in Vigrahavyiivartanf             is, in virtue of denying the existence of even his own view, completing a nihilistic program that denies existence of any kind to anything. As should be elear by now, I think that this nihilistic reading is untenable. Nonetheless, it is surely the case that Wood is correct in claiming that Nagarjuna wishes· to treat emptiness in exactly the way that he treats other phenomena-as empty-and that any theory about it that presupposes it has an essence most be false. I part company with Wood only when he goes on to interpret emptiness as complete nonexistence. A careful reading of Vigrahavyiivartani re- veals, as Wood notes, that             denies that he has a proposition (pratijlid), but not that he utters words. Nagarjuna is working to show the merely conventional character of his utterance and that its utility does not entail the existence of any convention-independent reality as its semantic value. But that is a far ery from nihilism. See Garfield (unpublished) for a more sustained discussion of emptiness and positionlessness.
141. Streng (1973) agrees. See chap. 6.
￼Examination of Views 359
from the conventional standpoint that all phenomena are empty and thai all views according to which they are not are to be relin- quished is to recognize from the ultimate standpoint that there are no phenomena to be empty and that no view attributing any charac- teristic to anything can be maintained. Even the emptiness of emp- tiness is empty. . . .

While not all of these texts are explicitly cited in my discussion, all have inftuenced my views and my treatment of the text in some ways. With some I am in almost complete agreement; with others I take issue in whole or in part. But all have been helpful to me in thinking about Niigiirjuna's argument. This is not, however, by any means meant to be a complete bibliography of useful works on Niigiirjuna-only an indication of what inftuenced me. The En- glish translations of canonical texts are given where available.

￼PHILOSOPHY I RELIGION
A NEW TRANSLA TION OF THE GREA TEST WORK BY MAHA Y ANA 8UDDHIS!\1'S !\10ST INFLUENTIAL PHILOSOPHER
The Buddhist saint Nagarjuna, who       in South India in approximately the second century CE, is undoubtedly the most important, influential, and widely studied Mahayana Buddhist philosopher. His many works include texts addressed to lay audiences, letters of advice to kings, and a set of penetrating metaphysical and epistemological treatises. His greatest philosophical work, the Mlilamadhyamakakarika-read and studied by philosophers in all major Buddhist schools of Tibet, China, Japan, and Korea-is one of the most influen- tial works in the history of Indian philosophy. Now, in The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way, Jay L. Garfield provides a elear and eminently readable translation of Naga1juna's seminal work, offering those with little or no prior knowledge of Buddhist philosophy a view into the profound logic of the Mlilamadhyamakakarika. He offers an illuminating verse-by-verse commentary that explains Nagarjuna's positions and arguments in the language of Western metaphysics and epistemology, and connects Nagarujuna's concerns to those of Western philosophers such as Sextus, Hume, and Wittgenstein.
An accessible translation of the foundational text for all Mahayana Buddhism, The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way will offer insight to all those interested in the nature of reality.
"Stands a very good chance of being the first English translation that conveys to the reader something of the profundity and puzzle of the original."
Gareth Sparham. Institute ofBuddhist Dialectics
"Garfield's interpretation of Nagarjuna is pleasingly elear and evinces a balanced appreciation of his soteriological concems as well as his dialectical subtlety."
Graham Parkes, University ofHawaii "The Fundamental Wisdom ofthe Middle Way will be enormously beneficial."
Guy Newland, Central Michigan University
Jay L. Garfield is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Hampshire in lndia Program (an exchange program with the Tibetan universities in exile) at Hampshire College. He is the author of Relief in Psychology, Cognitive Science: An lntroduction, and the forthcoming Western ldea/ism and lts Critics: A Textbook For Tibetan Monastic Universities.

            <Text>“…best understood as the process of drawing novel distinctions. It does not matter whether what is noticed is important or trivial, as long as it is new to the viewer. Actively drawing these distinctions keeps us situated in the present. It also makes us more aware of the context and perspective of our actions than if we rely upon distinctions and categories drawn in the past. Under this latter situation, rules and routines are more likely to govern our behavior [sic]. The process of drawing novel distinctions can lead to a number of diverse consequences, including (1) a greater sensitivity to one’s environment, (2) more openness to new information, (3) the creation of new categories for structuring perception and (4) enhanced awareness of multiple perspectives in problem solving. The subjective ‘feel’ of mindfulness is that of a heightened state of involvement and wakefulness or being in the present. This subjective state is the inherent common thread that ties together the extremely diverse observable consequences for the viewer. Mindfulness is not a cold cognitive process. When one is actively drawing novel distinctions, the whole individual is involved.” (Langer and Moldoveanu 1)</Text>

            <Text>Oliveros:

“…evoked potentials in the brain appear up to a half-second before the individual is aware of a stimulus. The brain then remembers the stimulus as happening in the present moment or the immediate instant in one’s sense of time. So perception in time is an illusion. Consciousness is awareness of stimuli and reactions in the moment. Consciousness is acting with awareness, presence and memory. What is learned is retained and retrievable. Information, knowledge of events, feelings and experiences can be brought forward from the past to the present. In this way one has self-recognition.” (xxi)

“Many waveforms after first experience are discarded unnoticed without conscious interpretation. Understanding and interpreting what the ear transmits to the brain is a process developing from instantaneous survival reactions to ideas that drive consciousness. The listening process continues throughout one’s lifetime.”</Text>

            <Text>Notes on distraction, attention and computers in education:

Jesper Aagaard: “Drawn to distraction: a qualitative study of off-task use of educational technology”

“Today’s educational system increasingly integrates digital devices such as laptops and tables in the classroom on the assumption that the use of these technologies will increase student motivation and learning.” (90)

“…research shows that students often use technologies for distractive purposes like off-task activity and multitasking.” (90)

“…off-task activity is not always a conscious choice.” (90) &lt;&lt; key to mindfulness. 

“Because of deeply sedimented bodily habits, students often experience habitual distraction in the form of pre reflective attraction towards certain frequently visited websites (e.g. Facebook).” (90) &lt;&lt; for my use it could at times be Facebook/other sites/email… but in the case of playing a max patch, the act of patching comes with other off-task potentials: stack-overflow/c74 forums (reference/social media), breaking the instrument, (think hard about others). 


“Students sometimes go as far as closing the lids of their laptops to avoid this habitual distraction.” (90) &lt;&lt; have certainly considered this — as long as an instrument is sufficiently abstracted (?) such that its controls/state are not on a screen and manipulatable using midi controls, mouse, etc, this is possible. But for some instruments this is not always possible or quite frankly necessary (or perhaps too restrictive).

“This empirical inquiry is informed by postphenomenology, which differs from classic cognitive theory by shifting focus from mental processes to bodily use of technologies.”(90) &lt;&lt; the mindfulness course emphasizes Wittgenstein

“Brief review of existing cognitive literature on attention and its inadequate consideration of embodiment and instead present a post phenomenological framework.” (90)


“According to cognitive psychology, attention is mostly voluntarily controlled by the mind  (this is endogenous, top-down, or goal-directed attention) but can also be redirected by unexpected external stimuli such as a loud noise or a flashing light (this is exogenous, bottom-up, or stimulus-driven attention) (Corbetta &amp; Shulman, 2002; Posner 1980) Attention is either directed from within or triggered from without. This division is readily adopted by educational researchers, who conclude that technological distraction is primarily voluntary and endogenous, but can also be caused by exogenous stimuli.” (91)
&gt;&gt; Aagaard points out that this is characterized by the Cartesian dualism of the mind-body, where, according to Ryle’s critique, the “…ethereal mind exists outside of space, beyond the laws of matter, while the material body is a mechanical instrument like a clock that functions merely as a handmaiden to the mind. A description of embodied first-person experience, however, rejects this dogma and shows the body to be active and skillful (Merleau-Ponty, 2002). …engaging with a [computer] is a highly embodied relation that includes being face-to-face with a screen and hands-on with a keyboard (Friesen, 2011) [and mouse]. An inadequate consideration of embodiment hinders an understanding of the manual nature of media use (Moores, 2014).” (91)

Postphenomenology for the “crucial relation between bodies and technology” (91) see also Ihde, 2002, 2010. 
Peter-Paul Verbeek on Postphenomenology:
“…study technology in terms of the relations between human beings and technological artifacts … various ways technologies help to shape relations between human beings and the world. They do not approach technologies as merely functional and instrumental objects, but as mediators of human experiences and practices.” (https://ppverbeek.wordpress.com/postphenomenology/)

Some key texts on post phenomenology: Ihde 1993, Rosenberger 2012, and Verbeek 2011

The ‘post’ in postphenomenology: ‘multi stability and embodiment’, where “multi stability ontologically replaces the essentialism of Husserlian phenomenology and alludes to an artifact’s various partially determined trajectories in different contexts (Hide, 2009). A technological artifact, as Don Hide puts it, becomes what it ‘is’ through its uses (Hide, 2990:70). A lighter, for instance, is usually applied to light a candle, but can also be used to open a bottle. There is no ‘essential’ use of a lighter. [computers] are even designed to incorporate this kind of multistability (Ihde, 2012) &lt;&lt; a hardware modular synth is a fine example of multi stability: each module itself is multistable, in that their use depends on their context: i.e. a delay can also be used as a filter. 

“Just as multistability replaces the essences of classical phenomenology, embodiment replaces a transcendental notion of subjectivity and its ‘disembodied view-from-nowhere’ (Ihde, 2008:3). Post-phenomenology is not concerned with immaterial consciousness, but with situated, embodied relations to material technologies. Using a lighter to open a bottle requires different handling than when used to light a candle.” (91)

“Performing different actions with technological artifacts requires different relational strategies, i.e. bodily habits, intentions, and conceptions (Rosenberger, 2009). A relational strategy is what fixes the multi stability of a given artifact to a specific stability. … Rosenberger uses the concept to explain the use of computers where a novice is forced to concentrate

A description of embodied first-person experience, however, rejects this dogma and shows the body to be active and skillful (Merleau-Ponty, 2002). …engaging with a [computer] is a highly embodied relation that includes being face-to-face with a screen and hands-on with a keyboard (Friesen, 2011) [and mouse]. An inadequate consideration of embodiment hinders an understanding of the manual nature of media use (Moores, 2014).” (91)


“Students often described the temptation to engage in off-task activity as a pre-reflective attraction towards frequently visited, educationally unrelated websites. “ (93)

Pre-reflective consciousness is the experience which precedes the first-person realization of the experience. 

When engaging in musical improvisation with a digital musical instrument on a laptop, given either their potential multistabilities, one is subjected to multiple sources of distraction. In the case of a digital musical instrument, improvisation leads one to experiment with the affordances and constraints of the system, yet rather than keeping this exploration contained within manual operation of the instrument, often one’s attention gives way to a pre-reflective (Sartre? Aagaard 91, 93) instinct to stop playing and modify its structure in realtime —make edits to its code — which is a music-adjacent activity. In the case of the laptop with its “…sources of [cognitive] overload and distraction … [such as] the orientation and visual nature of laptops, along with pop-ups, instant messages, movement and lighting of text, and even things like low-battery warnings, make laptops inherently distracting. (Bhave 2002; Melerdiercks 2005; Wickets &amp; Hollands 2002)” (Fried 908) ( I lest one not consciously seek and employ different relational strategies (Aagaard 91). “ with the pitfall [reword] of ‘pre reflective attraction towards’ making edits to the structure of the instrument, and that as this comes in place of learning how to execute the desired sound/musical idea with the instrument in its current structure, it is common that one will find oneself in deep in the track of editing (which also involves extending ones mind into user forums for help,  ‘edit mode’ before 
&gt; a Modular synthesizer, although made of discrete units which are themselves multistable, is not multistable in the same way as a laptop. A modular synthesizer is not engineered nor sold with the promise of being able to do anything other than produce or manipulate sound — it cannot be used to send an email nor check the weather. While the individual modules can be rearranged in space and patched together in different ways, their own circuits are fixed, and so the interface — knobs, switches, and patch points — is the lowest level of abstraction of the overall system available to the performer. This is in contrast with code-based digital musical instruments, where not only can the interface be modified, but also the components and systems that the interface represents can be deconstructed, edited, broken, rearranged and added to. In other words, the degree to which the instrument’s own structure is fixed during use binds the performer to remaining engaged with its intended usage: listening to and playing with other fellow performers. While the act of editing the code of an instrument can be done in a mindful way, it would be done at the expense of listening to other performers in an ensemble and responding in real time. 

, so there is a higher order of abstraction compared with code-based synthesis,

            <Text>Abstract/Introduction

This paper is about the value of mindfulness practice in technologically-mediated music making, design, and performance. The multifunctional laptop computer, while alluring, conditions its users towards a propensity for distraction by encouraging off-task activity and multitasking, potentially hindering a focused creative process. This is examined in contrast with a modular synthesizer, an electronic device with a more singular purpose as a musical instrument. Drawing on the course text How to Cook Your Life, the virtue of mindfully attending to one’s activity is considered, be it musical as in the case of free-form improvisation, or music-adjacent such as packing up equipment following a performance. The paper concludes on the role of mindful listening in the context of free-form music improvisation. 

To begin, this paper is situated within the context of the author’s own discipline, that of experimental and electroacoustic music. An electroacoustic composer seeks out novel sounds, and holds a curiosity toward the means of the production of novel sounds, and a desire to experiment with these means and procedures. Often is the case that such procedures are afforded through the development of custom computer software which can manipulate sound to produce ever-interesting sonic results. This practice requires an investment in several disciplines, including knowledge of music, listening skills, improvisation, design, and computational literacy. (diSessa 5) 

However, creating music while using a laptop computer can have its deficits, particularly when it comes to sustaining one’s attention on a singular task, which stands in opposition to a predominant feature of modern computers: multitasking. According to Jesper Aagaard, “multitasking does not in fact denote a quantitative enumeration of tasks, but a qualitative distinction between on- and off-task activity. In other words, multitasking is functionally equivalent to distraction.” (Multitasking as Distraction: A Conceptual Analysis of Media Multitasking Research 1) The propensity of computer usage in music-making towards multitasking runs counter to a mindful approach to creativity. While learning how to program affords the opportunity to create instruments capable of realizing novel compositional ideas, the increased engagement with a computer often means that it is increasingly difficult to remain present and focused as a listener. This challenge is intensified when the electroacoustic musician plays instruments which they had designed: during an improvisation — or even practising at home — when encountering a new limitation in what the instrument is capable of, they so often became distracted by immediately excitedly thinking about the addition of new modifications, something to change in the instrument, that they would abandon their playing to set off making those modifications. Hours would pass and the activity and intention was no longer about music making, but instead consumed by design thinking. As the degree to which one is focused does not change, the satisfaction experienced from the activity feels similar. 
At first, programming — a creative act unto itself — feels like playing music, but without listening involved. Without intentionally setting one’s mind on to the singular focus of playing an instrument, and acknowledging and declining urges to switch to an off-task such as programming, one can become disillusioned toward computer-mediated music performance because it seemingly begins to encompass more than playing the instrument. This tendency toward distracted use of technology is consistent with contemporary educational research on attention in computationally-mediated classrooms, in which students have been documented succumbing to the “…temptation to engage in off-task activity [and that this is] a pre-reflective attraction towards frequently visited, educationally unrelated websites.” (Drawn to Distraction: A Qualitative Study of Off-Task use of Educational Technology 93)

Post-phenomenology is useful in the context of human-computer interaction, and its notions of multistability and embodiment (Drawn to Distraction 91) are salient to a discussion of mindfulness and creativity in the context of technologically mediated art. Post-phenomenology dispatches with the notion of a technology’s essence, and through the notion of multistability describes a particular technology’s identity as contingent upon how it is used, (“Bodies in Technology” 70) and in the case of a laptop computer, multistability has regularly become a targeted design pattern. (Can Continental Philosophy Deal with the New Technologies? 326) In other words, a laptop possesses such stabilities as a writing tool, musical instrument, and movie player, etc. 

When engaging in musical improvisation with a custom digital musical instrument on a laptop, given either their potential multistabilities, one is subjected to multiple sources of distraction. In the case of a digital musical instrument, improvisation leads one to experiment with the affordances and constraints of the system, yet rather than keeping this exploration contained within manual operation of the instrument, often one’s attention gives way to an instinct to stop playing and modify its structure in realtime — make edits to its code — which is a music-adjacent activity. In the case of the laptop with its “…sources of [cognitive] overload and distraction … [such as] the orientation and visual nature of laptops, along with pop-ups, instant messages, movement and lighting of text, and even things like low-battery warnings, make laptops inherently distracting. (Bhave 2002; Melerdiercks 2005; Wickets &amp; Hollands 2002)” (Fried 908)

Post-phenomenology is also informed by “…embodied relations to material technologies.” (Drawn to Distraction 91) Given a particular technology’s multistability, one performs different actions in order to successfully use the technology in different ways: an acoustic guitar can be used as a melodic instrument, but also as a hand drum. Rosenberger terms these actions relational strategies, contingent upon a human performer’s manual handling of the technology they are what constrain a technology to a particular stability. (Rosenberger 176) 

When compared to a computer, an acoustic instrument may have multiple stabilities, but there are no computer screens nor alerts to draw one’s attention away from sound and musical creativity. A guitar will remain a guitar regardless of what modifications are envisioned. An instrument which has an open amount of stabilities and encourages re-configuration of its system, yet constrains its purpose towards music making is a special type of electronic instrument called a hardware modular synthesizer. Its uniqueness as an instrument is that it is an analog computer whose components are left partially disconnected, allowing for the player to partially reshape the function and behaviour of the machine by creating temporary electrical connections, called patches, between these components. In this regard, the act of playing a modular synthesizer is similar to the practice of live coding (Hutchins 147) which is the on-stage performance practice of programming code which generates live music. In other words, learning to play an instrument whose musical affordances and constraints may be defined and redefined during performance meant that a passion for design thinking can be legitimately incorporated within a real-time musical practice. In the case of laptop-based music making, the impulse to reprogram a system would require a shift in focus, attention, and intention such that the result would not only be less musical, but due to the split in attention the ears would not be discerning of such output, and the player would also be subject to further potential distraction in the form of notifications, whereas with the modular synthesizer the mind and focus is bound by the sound being generated contemporaneously, and bound by an intention to explore this sound through the continual retuning of the system. 

Performing with a hardware modular synthesizer is a highly embodied, first-person experience. The act of controlling such a device — its relational strategy — is contingent on gestures specific to the tactile affordances of physical knobs, switches, and patching. This is contrasted in the case of laptop-based digital musical instruments by the fact that the control data generated from the more multistable mouse and keyboard are mapped onto the musical parameters. In either case, the understanding of the state of the instrument is informed partially by the visible interface, and partially in the imagination.

On the morning of April 9th the author presented on Kōshō Uchiyama Rōshi’s book How to Cook Your Life: from the Zen Kitchen to Enlightenment (Dogen, Wright, Uchiyama 2005), one of the assigned readings for the course Introduction to Mindfulness: Understanding and Using Mindfulness in the Professions. Throughout the reading of the book, it was apparent that the discussion around the path of the Tenzo Kyokun and “…his pursuit of the Way” (Dogen 3), could serve as allegorical to the experience of a life dedicated to exploring sound, such as the author of this paper — a composer and musician — has, and so it was decided that the presentation would be designed to incorporate and heighten awareness of the sounds of the classroom, including for example, the persistent din of the HVAC system. The composer’s primary instrument — a synthesizer — was also prepared for the class as an accompaniment alongside the soundscape of the room. Doing so was intended to foreground the considerable responsibility of having some influence over the sonic environment of the room such that it could provide space for breath, thought, and yet also modulate class members’ mindfulness by periodically introducing moments of novelty. (Langer and Moldoveanu 1) 

The author conducted a one hour yoga practice before sunrise and then arrived on campus an hour before class. In the time before class, the synthesizer patch was constructed for the class, iteratively prepared from a blank state (no patch connections). How this was conducted was designed to be aligned with a mindful approach as per the preparing of rice, as was insisted upon by Tenzo Kyokun in Instructions for the Zen Cook:

When washing the rice, remove any sand you find. In doing so, do not lose even one grain of rice. When you look at the rice see the sand at the same time; when you look at the sand, see also the rice. Examine both carefully. Then, a meal containing the six flavours and the three qualities will come together naturally. … In order to not lose any of the rice when picking out the sand, do it carefully with your own hands. Again, in the Chanyuan Qinggui we find ‘Pay full attention to your work in preparing the meal; attend to every aspect yourself so that it will naturally turn out well.’” (Dōgen 5)

Gentle deliberation was paid to the handling and interaction with each module, cable, and accessory belonging to the modular synthesizer. The emphasis with which Tenzo Kyokun placed upon the care and attention to finest detail when washing rice was particularly instructive: a modular synthesizer, though its chassis is made of metals and fastened with screws, is nevertheless a rather delicate electrical apparatus susceptible to damage from falls, and moisture. Great care must also be taken when unpacking this instrument from its case. As it is an electronic instrument, the question of how to safely store cables and other accessories is paramount, as is their subsequent retrieval at a later time. Often, items such as cables are layered upon each other, and so it is important when reaching for one or more cables that one is aware of how many cables they are clutching, and that the whole of the cable may be freely drawn from the case without snagging or pulling on other items in its vicinity. Cables are colour-coded according to their length. A well maintained collection of cables will also include cable ties — 20-30cm lengths of string or velcro straps — for each cable. These are used to secure a cable in its coiled form, and will also prevent it from becoming tangled with other cables. Failure to adhere to the use of cable ties has as its consequences lost time due to untangling, and potential damage to the integrity of the cable’s construction. Cable ties should already be secured to a fixed point somewhere along the cable, usually close to one of the ends, such that they do not become displaced when their cable is uncoiled, nor lost between the stages of unpacking and packing. 
 Equally important is the act of tidying one’s music equipment following the conclusion of a session or performance. A proper method of cable wrapping takes effort, concentration, and tactile sensing, and is necessary to ensure both longevity of use and effectiveness. One holds an end of a cable in one hand, and with their thumb, fore and middle fingers on the other hand, gently pinches the cable about an arm’s length away from the same end, and pulls that point of the cable towards the first hand, gently twisting the cable in what feels like the direction it wants to turn, resulting in a single loop. Continue with this gesture but be aware of the direction that the cable wants to twist: twisting it in one direction will come at a greater ease than the other. The cable should not be made to wrap around one’s elbow and shoulder, as this stretches the interior wires and compromises the protective exterior coating. One can verify that care was taken to properly coil a cable by holding one of the ends in one hand, and tossing the entire loop forward in front of oneself. When thrown in this manner, a correctly coiled cable will spill out in an even trajectory, whereas an uneven one will get caught on itself, or twist and land in ways unpleasing to the eye. The sound of a correctly coiled cable unfolding along a surface in the correct way is a satisfying sounding klaaattt. When put to use again later on, a correctly coiled cable will also be amenable to its desired placement in a space, whereas a cable that was coiled hastily and without regard for its natural twist will be much harder to lay down flat, and therefore will require more effort to ensure that it is not a tripping hazard. When the cable has been fully coiled, locate its tie and secure its loop with a single, tight the bow such that it does not untie in storage or during travel.

A challenging aspect of being involved in technologically mediated music is that one is regularly presented with pressure to acquire more equipment, and especially presented with the notion that some equipment is better than others. That the acquiring of ever more expensive ‘pro’ audio equipment will lead to better more professional sounding music. This aspect of Western culture always risks relegating technologically mediated musicians as hungry ghosts. (Dogen 24) In discussing the experience of taste, Master Dogen eschews the 
…[distinction of] delicacies or plain food, [that] there is just one taste, and it is the buddhadarma, the world itself as it is. … delicious and ordinary tastes are the same and not two. …A dish is not necessarily superior because you have prepared it with choice ingredients, nor is a soup inferior because you have made it with ordinary greens. When handling and selecting greens, do so wholeheartedly, with a pure mind, and without trying to evaluate their quality, in the same way in which you would prepare a splendid feast. (Dogen 13) 

During the hour-long preparation of the synthesizer prior to the presentation on April 9th, the act of listening to the mechanics of one’s actions was explored and documented. When selecting a cable, the author would rummage through the box of available cables and listened intently to the sound of cable ends knocking into each other [klack]. Some cables had to be separated or untangled [ssssspppp, klack, hrrrhrr]; plugging one end of the cable to an oscillator module’s output [shk-shkkkkk-chunk]; the other end into the speaker input [shk-shkkkkk-chunnnk] and while one expected to hear the sound of the oscillator immediately following this sequence of actions [fweeeeee], the timbre and frequency of the sound was novel [fwoooooo]. And so it goes in modular synthesis, there is a persistent curiosity towards creating new relationships between sounds and then conditioning the ways in which they influence each other, listening for novelty, and then seeking out another part of the circuit to experiment with.  During the course of this improvisation session, a patch was realized which which would play a transient, punctuated sound, which to the author evoked the imagery of a sōzu — a type of aural scarecrow from Japan which which slowly fills up water, and then tips over due to the weight, striking a rock as it spills its load, and then repeats.  In an estimation, this short sound occurred as frequently as once per five to ten minutes. 
For the introduction of the presentation, the author chose to conduct a listening meditation, one that involved an oscillation between local and global listening. This listening meditation asked the members of the class to focus on one single particular sound heard in the room’s soundscape, a local sound. This could have included, for example, a persistent din which seemed to originate from somewhere within the T-bar ceiling, perhaps an HVAC system; it could also include the sound of one’s breath; or the sound of footsteps in the hallway. They were asked to listen to that sound, get to know it. If it is continuous, listen to where it comes from and where it is going. If it is intermittent, begin to anticipate it, and then listen to where it comes from and where it is going. Try to build an understanding of the quality of the sound, imagine that one could recreate that sound in their ear later in the day. Then, they were asked to shift their focus back to the global sound, the soundscape of the room, the perceived combination of all sounds at once. Try to account for all sounds. Then, listen for that earlier local sound in the global. Note how the local interacts with the global. After that, move on to another local sound and repeat the process.
This listening meditation was run for approximately fifteen minutes, and was inspired by the practice of Deep Listening, which is a work of the late composer Pauline Oliveros. Up until recently, the author’s listening practice was informed by ear training based in Western tonality, psychoacoustics and auditory scene analysis; whereas in the past few years the practice of Deep Listening has also become incorporated. This is not to be confused with the ‘deep listening’ as one of Thich Nhat Hanh’s Five Mindfulness Trainings, which is “…compassion-centered listening to restore communication in order to relieve suffering and bring happiness to all beings. Listening (as a practice in this sense) would be training to respond with calmness and clarity of mind. It is a determination and commitment to reconcile and resolve conflicts.” (Oliveros xxiv) Instead, Deep Listening in the music context, according to its progenitor Pauline Oliveros, 

is a practice that is intended to heighten and expand consciousness of sound in as many dimensions of awareness and attentional dynamics as humanly possible. … [Deep Listening] comes from noticing my listening or listening to my listening and discerning the effects on my bodymind continuum, from listening to others, to art and to life. (Oliveros xxiv)

One element common to both cooking and playing music is time, and more specifically ephemerality. If food begins to brown and dry out, water can be added to compensate for some properties, such as moisture, to begin to bring it away from further charring, but it will never be quite the same as it was before. A hardware modular synthesizer, being a machine with no stored memory and unlike its software-based counterparts, is one in which changes cannot be precisely undone. These constraints are partly what contributes to a liveness in either activity, but more important is that no thing will remain in its state forever, evoking what professor Orr referred to as “…the fundamental delusion [being] the one of the reified self. We think we are going to last forever.” (Orr)

In the case of musical free improvisation play, the key elements here are that there is mutual influence: players control the output of their instruments, but their positions relative to each other and relative to their acoustic space will condition how and what they hear. Similarly,  “…the means whereby we turn things even while simultaneously we are being turned by them…” (Dogen 7) 
This is further evoked by the Tenzo’s discussion of two people beholding the same cup, that two musicians may be hearing the same sound, but will listen to them differently. 

When we look at a cup that is set down between two of us, we have the feeling that we are looking at the same cup, though actually, that is not so. You look at the cup with your vision, and from a certain angle. Moreover, you see it in the rays of light and shadows that come from your side of the room. This applies equally to me as well. In a very rough sense, we proceed to separate the reality of the situation by entertaining the idea that we both see the same cup. This is what I mean by the fabrication of ideas. (Dogen 27)

Both musicians share some responsibility for the sound, but for several reasons they will hear it differently, (Oliveros xxii) indicating a sonic and perhaps thematic multistability.

Specifically, this refers to the act of programming which can take over the creative act of music making, and that the propensity of computer usage in music making towards constant task switching is detrimental towards mindfulness.

            <Text>“Deep Listening is a practice that is intended to heighten and expand consciousness of sound in as many dimensions of awareness and attentional dynamics as humanly possible. … [DL] comes from noticing my listening or listening to my listening and discerning the effects on my bodymind continuum, from listening to others, to art and to life.” (Xxiv)

“Deep Listening is a practice and term that does not come from any religious context, even though religious practitioners sometimes use the words. Which That Hanh is a Zen Buddhist Monk whose usage of the term “deep listening” has a specific context as one of the “Five Mindfulness Trainings” that he proposes. This is a compassion-centered listening to restore communication in order to relieve suffering and bring happiness to all beings. Listening (as a practice in this sense) would be training to respond with calmness and clarity of mind. It is a determination and commitment to reconcile and resolve conflicts.” (Xxiv)

“Meditation in all the meanings of the word is found and defined in diverse religions and spiritual practices. Meditation is used in all its rich variety of meanings to calm the mind and to promote receptivity or concentration. In religious settings, attention is directed to moral and ethical issues, values, beliefs and tenets of the particular faith and to connection with the divine or a divine being, or beings. “

            <Text>Similarity between cooking and playing hardware modular synths is ephemerality. 

If food begins to brown and dry out, I can add water to compensate for some properties (moisture) begin to bring it away from further charring, but it will never be quite the same as it was before. Similarly, with the hardware MS, a change cannot be precisely reversed. “The fundamental delusion is the one of the reified self. We think we are going to last forever.” (Debra, In class March 26)


On mutual influence in music performance. Reflection #1: the listening mediation I led during my class presentation 



I am trained as a composer, with a particular focus on the use of electronics in sound generation and manipulation. I seek out novel sounds, and hold a curiosity towards the means with which to produce such sounds and a desire to experiment with these processes. For most of my career, this was afforded by developing custom computer software which could manipulate sound in ever interesting ways. This practice required an investment in several disciplines: knowledge of music, listening skills, improvisation, design, and computational literacy. (diSessa 5) However, I found it incredibly difficult to remain present and focused as a listener when playing instruments which I had designed, because I would think of something to change in the instrument, and then set off making those modifications. Hours would pass and the activity and intention was no longer about music making, but instead consumed by design thinking. I became disillusioned toward computer-mediated music performance, simply because I was unwilling to practice setting my mind on the singular task of playing and staying the course whenever my mind became attracted to rethinking the design. I gradually began to design software for other musicians to use, and relegated my own music practice away from the computer to playing guitar: there are no computer screens to draw my attention away from sound and musical creativity, and the guitar will remain a guitar regardless of what modifications I envision because I do not possess confident luthier skills. More recently, however, I began to learn to play a special type of electronic instrument called a hardware modular synthesizer. Its uniqueness as an instrument is that it is an analog computer whose components are left partially disconnected, allowing for the player to reshape the function and behaviour of the machine by creating temporary electrical connections, called patches, between these components. In this regard, the act of playing a modular synthesizer is [similar to] the practice of live coding (Hutchins 147), or the on-stage performance practice of programming code which generates live music. In other words, learning to play an instrument whose affordances and constraints and may be defined and redefined during performance meant that my passion for design thinking could be legitimately incorporated within a real-time musical practice. What I found, was that the impulse to reprogram the system that in the case of computer software-mediated music making would completely remove me from the process of music-making, instead I always find my mind and focus bound by the sound being generated contemporaneously, and bound by an intention to explore this sound through the continual retuning of the system. 

On the morning of April 9th I was to present my interpretation and reflection on Kōshō Uchiyama Rōshi’s book How to Cook Your Life. Within the first few pages I began to see parallels between the life and tenets of the Tenzo and a composer, and so it was decided that the presentation would be designed to incorporate and heighten awareness of the sounds of the classroom. 



It was decided that for the presentation, a synthesizer patch would be designed as an accompaniement alongside the soundscape of the room. Doing so could foreground what I regarded as my own responsibility of influencing the sonic environment of the room such that it could provide space for breath, thought, and yet also create surprising moments (novelty). That morning, I did a one hour yoga practice before sunrise and then arrived on campus an hour before class. In the time before class, I prepared the synth patch for the presentation. I attempted to follow the rules outlined in Tenzo Kyokun’s Introductions for the Zen Cook, where I paid careful attention to each object and subject in front of me, and added to this the act of listening to the mechanics of my actions: when selecting a cable, I would rummage through the cable box and so I listened intently to the sound of cable ends knocking into each other [klack]. Some cables had to be separated or untangled [ssssspppp, klack, hrrrhrr]; plugging one end of the cable to an oscillator module’s output [shk-shkkkkk-chunk]; the other end into the speaker input [shk-shkkkkk-chunnnk] and while I expected to hear the sound of the oscillator immediately following this sequence of actions [fweeeeee], the timbre and frequency of the sound was novel [fwoooooo]. And so it goes in modular synthesis, there is a persistent curiosity towards creating new relationships between sounds and then conditioning the ways in which they influence each other, listening for novelty, and then seeking out another part of the circuit to experiment with.  During the course of this improvisation session, a patch was realized which which would play a transient, punctuated sound, which to the author evoked the imagery of a sōzu — a type of aural scarecrow from Japan which which slowly fills up water, and then tips over due to the weight, striking a rock as it spills its load, and then repeats.  In my estimation, this short sound occurred as frequently as once per five to ten minutes. 

The emphasis with which Master Dōgen placed upon the care and attention to finest detail when washing rice was particularly instructive: great care must also be taken when unpacking one’s instrument from its case. In the context of an electric instrument, one must carefully retrieve cables and other accessories from their storage. Often, items such as cables are layered upon each other, and so it is important when reaching for one or more cables that one is aware of how many cables they are clutching, and that the whole of the cable may be freely drawn from the case without snagging or pulling on other items in its vicinity. A well maintained collection of cables should include cable ties — 20-30cm lengths of string or velcro straps — for each cable, used to secure its state as a loop, preventing multiple cables from becoming tangled which has as its consequences lost time due to untangling, and potential damage to the integrity of the cable’s construction. Cable ties should already be secured to a fixed point somewhere along the cable, usually close to one of the ends, such that they are not lost between the stages of unpacking and packing. 
 Equally important is the act of tidying one’s music equipment following the conclusion of a session or performance. A proper method of cable wrapping takes effort, concentration, and tactile sensing, and is necessary to ensure both longevity of use and effectiveness. One holds an end of a cable in one hand, and with their thumb, fore and middle fingers on the other hand, gently pinches the cable about an arm’s length away from the same end, and pulls that point of the cable towards the first hand, gently twisting the cable in what feels like the direction it wants to turn, resulting in a single loop. Continue with this gesture but be aware of the direction that the cable wants to twist: twisting it in one direction will come at a greater ease than the other. The cable should not be made to wrap around one’s elbow and shoulder, as this stretches the interior wires and wears out the protective exterior coating. When the cable has been fully coiled, use a short length of rope or a cable tie to secure the loop in place such that it does not unravel in storage or during travel. One can verify that care was taken to properly coil a cable by holding one of the ends in one hand, and tossing the entire loop forward in front of oneself. A correctly coiled cable will spill out in an even trajectory, whereas an uneven one will get caught on itself, or twist in ways unpleasing to the eye. The sound of a correctly coiled cable unfolding in this way is satisfying splat. A correctly coiled cable will also be amenable to its desired placement in a space, while a cable that was coiled hastily and without regard for its natural twist will be much harder to lay down flat, is much more likely to be a tripping hazard. 

from the end the cable bet and failure to adhere to this and as important is the clean up following a session: it is certainly possible to damage a cable by wrapping it too tightly, and with a hardware modular there are so many cables one could easily forget to pack one before leaving, akin to leaving behind one of the strings of a violin following the end of a performance. 	

For the morning meditation portion of my class presentation, I chose to do a listening meditation 
Reflection #2 Playing music with others


Reflection #3 A multi-player instrument (bass into synth setup between yourself on modular and Jared on bass). The key elements here are that there is mutual influence: the bass controls aspects of the synth signal, the synth controls aspects of the bass signal, and both of us are listening to each other and being influenced by the other.  “…the means whereby we turn things even while simultaneously we are being turned by them.” (Dogen 7) “When practicing the Way, from the very beginning, listen to the teacher and conduct your self in accordance with his teaching. You should remember and know thoroughly that dharma turns the Self [all phenomena influence us] and that the self turns dharma [ we influence all dharma or phenomena]. When we influence dharma, dharma is weak and we are strong. When dharma influences us, dharma is strong and we are weak. Both of these principles have always been a part of the Teachings of the buddhadarma.” (Yojinshu in Dogen 101)

[[insert a reflection on the idea of two people beholding the same cup, on two musicians are listening to the same sound. In the case of the multi-player instrument, both musicians share some responsibility for the sound, but for several reasons they will hear it differently (invoke Oliveros’ distinction between listening vs hearing) This is  : “When we look at a cup that is set down between two of us, we have the feeling that we are looking at the same cup, though actually, that is not so. You look at the cup with your vision, and from a certain angle. Moreover, you see it in the rays of light and shadows that come from your side of the room. This applies equally to me as well. In a very rough sense, we proceed to separate the reality of the situation by entertaining the idea that we both see the same cup. This is what I mean by the fabrication of ideas.” (Dogen 27)


“A dish is not necessarily superior because you have prepared it with choice ingredients, nor is a soup inferior because you have made it with ordinary greens. When handling and selecting greens, do so wholeheartedly, with a pure mind, and without trying to evaluate their quality, in the same way in which you would prepare a splendid feast.” (Dogen 13) As with any hobby within a capitalist society, a challenging aspect of being involved in technologically mediated music is that one is regularly presented with pressure to acquire more equipment, and especially presented with the notion that some equipment is better than others. In discussing the experience of taste, Master Dogen eschews the “…[distinction of] delicacies or plain food, [that] there is just one taste, and it is the buddhadarma, the world itself as it is. … delicious and ordinary tastes are the same and not two.” (Dogen 13) [[might also be able to relate the ‘hungry ghost’ here page 24. The hungry ghost always wants something, can’t get enough)
