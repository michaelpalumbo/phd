## discussion on nationalism-trumpism & what do we do about it (potentially as buddhists)
"we trick ourselves into thinking that the idea of walls is something very foreign to us; and yet when we step into a subway train and there is a person sleeping on the seats who has [pissed themselves], we put up a psychic wall. ... if this is possible, then how easy is it for one to think about creating a wall around [land borders]..." (Richard)

Debra in response to Richard: "That is why we need meditation, is it gets away from our conditioning."

"...look at the ways i would automatically react to something out of self-protectionism ... importance of sitting with the other ... this is the beauty of what jesus is ... the people who have achieved the waking heart and can turn to those suffering ... the buddha and the lived experience ..." (Richard)


## discussion 
Debra mentioned that the reason that a lot of the writing is so repetitive is that it came from an oral culture. 

## discussion on texts
on chinese language: understanding of things in the world is based on field and focus (referring to an object depends on its context)

on english language: 'dualistic ... 


# pali canon
sense of where it came from, out of yoga and then through a change in the traditions. 
- birth and early years: "Ananda remembered this perfect quality ..." 


individualistic: 

"Only the one who rejects the empire is fit to run it." (Richard quoting someone else, ask)

Don't let running the state be a position of power, let it be what is given (Michael Walzer). he talks about spheres of influence, function way beyond money. crude example is that if you have money you can pay for sex, which means you don't have to be attractive/enticing/appealing, etc. (Richard mentioned this)

my response to the discussion around individualism, which was largely focusing on the pursuit of status and resources to further one's own power within a society. I brought up the frans de waal TED talk on the alpha, which pushed back against the conception of the alpha as the bully, rather in chimp society the alpha is the one who engages empathy. I questioned if another way of thinking about empathy in view of the buddha, is that if I choose to make empathy be my primary focus, reaching out, could this not be my individual? that whatever comes from the actions guided by empathy (perhaps adoration, power, money). Buddha, in seeking suffering, is espoused by others, but his intention and focus is not this espousal and thus his value to his group is not his status or power, but his ability for empathy. 



Karma: perhaps I could think of 




when you are driving, you can't (likely) verbally communicate with other drivers. Driving relies on non-linguistic relation to others. Your mindful state, I presume, is going to condition your decisions, which to others is your behaviour. So how you tune yourself as the individual is also going to tune the group. 


One's response to their own response: the 1st arrow a person's immediate reaction to a stimulus, and the second arrow is **that same person's** response to their 1st arrow response. Seems the second arrow is a self-critical response, and can be negative or positive. Richard mentioned that mindfulness is the ability to be ambivalent to the 1st arrow, **however** the less you second arrow, the less impact the 1st arrow has. 


imIMPORTANT! THE 1ST ESSAY CAN NOW BE OF YOUR OWN TOPIC, BUT IDEALLY RELATING TO THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE COURSE THUS FAR.
