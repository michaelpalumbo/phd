"we trick ourselves into thinking that the idea of walls is something very foreign to us; and yet when we step into a subway train and there is a person sleeping on the seats who has [pissed themselves], we put up a psychic wall. ... if this is possible, then how easy is it for one to think about creating a wall around [land borders]..." (Richard)

"...look at the ways i would automatically react to something out of self-protectionism ... importance of sitting with the other ... this is the beauty of what jesus is ... the people who have achieved the waking heart and can turn to those suffering ... the buddha and the lived experience ..." (Richard)
