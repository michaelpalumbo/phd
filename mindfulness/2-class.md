neurology of reading a face (current sci american issue)

place hands behind head, and look eyes to as far right as you can (periphery) until yo feel a yawn coming, then look the other way. repeat. simple manipulation of the ossiput (just behind the ear?) nerves behind the spine. just moving your eyes to the right and left is enough to stimulate the vagas nerve for regulation and social engagement. it relaxes you. 

- how buddhism and yoga became part of western culture. there was a movement to health and fitness. yoga found a way to commodify itself. 

- "classical yoga: the mother of buddhism" (source?)
- yoga goes back as far as ~2500 BCE. yoga means a connecting together of things. in classical yoga, there is only one position (seated), this is 'asana'. verksana (tree pose). beyond that there wasn't much asana development until ~1500. it wasn't until the late 1800s that the hundreds of asana. krishina macharya wrote a book on all of the hunders of asanas. ayengar learned from Macharya. if you want a scholarly intro, see Ayengar's writing on Petangeli. 

- Ayengar was one of the first Yogis to come to the west. 

- hatha yoga became adapted for healthcare. 

## Yoga Sutras
Yoga is considered as a distinct drasana. 

samskhya: fundamentally a dualistic way of speaking. it accepts two different views. 
drasanas

everything is made up of these two: 
Pakrti: the body, we get impulses and unproductive behaviour, and thoughts that aren't reality. pakrti obscures the view of purusa. 

Purusa (pronounced 'per-ru-sha'): eternal spiritual aspect. 

Yoga calms the Paktri, making space for purusa. 

ethics is a modern way of looking at how we should relate. 


on bringing it back to the self as personal responsibility. friction is important though. 

acceptance, softness, flexibility. 

mind like water: when you drop a stone in water, the water knows exactly how to react, then goes back to stillness. 


## intense discipline
paradox of needing to be discipline 

is discipline the practice, or is discipline what you apply to your practice? (Me)
