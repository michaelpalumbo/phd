neurology of reading a face (current sci american issue)

place hands behind head, and look eyes to as far right as you can (periphery) until yo feel a yawn coming, then look the other way. repeat. simple manipulation of the ossiput (just behind the ear?) nerves behind the spine. just moving your eyes to the right and left is enough to stimulate the vagas nerve for regulation and social engagement. it relaxes you. 

- how buddhism and yoga became part of western culture. there was a movement to health and fitness. yoga found a way to commodify itself.

## Yoga Sutras
Yoga is considered as a distinct drasana. 

samskhya: fundamentally a dualistic way of speaking. it accepts two different views. 
drasanas

everything is made up of these two: 
Pakrti: the body, we get impulses and unproductive behaviour, and thoughts that aren't reality. pakrti obscures the view of purusa. 

Purusa (pronounced 'per-ru-sha'): eternal spiritual aspect. 

Yoga calms the Paktri, making space for purusa. 

ethics is a modern way of looking at how we should relate.
