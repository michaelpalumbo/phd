**my ideas**
make a commit each time you notice your mind is drifting from whatever is in front of you (i.e. someone in class is speaking, i'm reading, etc.) make a macro that dirties a file called 'mindful', adds it, commits it, tags the commit. or maybe just add it to a JSON. this would be neat to integrate into your research paper later on. 

maybe it makes better sense to do this inside a folder in ~/phd

**ideas from the course**

Buddhism is about losing your sense of self.  
  - *the great awakening social theory* by David Loy. 

"all that we are is a result of what we have thought" (Debra quotes this in class, I don't know where its from)

most of what we are thinking is delusion.

in anger, the first person you hurt is yourself.
