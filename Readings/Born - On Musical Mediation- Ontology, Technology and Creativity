Born's 'musical assemblage', defined as:
	"....as a particular combination of mediations (sonic, discursive, visual, artefactual, technological, social, temporal) characteristic of acertain musical culture and historical period. This definition draws on chapter 3 of Rabinow's 'Anthropos Today', and on Deleuze's reading of Foucault (in 'Foucault')"


Music "...favours assocations or assemblages between musicians and instruments, composers and scores, listeners and sound systems -- that is between subjects and objects." (7)

On Lydia Goehr's "...critique of the concept of the musical work" (7) Born states that Goehr "... raises but does no pursue the importance for contemporary music of an approach that incorporates understandings of the social, technological and temporal dimensions of music." (7-8)

	+ Born's 3 arguments on a theory of mediation that supports this: 

		1. "...music's social and temporal mediation and its nature as a distributed object." (8)
			- Draws on "Art and Agency" (Gell)
			- where, "...music [is] a medium that destabilizes some of our most cherished dualisms concerning the separation not only of subject from object, but present from past, individual from collectivity, the authentic from the artificial, and production from reception."
		2. "...music's mediations have taken a number of forms, cohering into what we might term [musical] assemblages, which themselves endure and take particular historical shapes." (8)
		3. "...this approach has value in highlighting shifts in the dominant historical forms of musical assemblage. "
